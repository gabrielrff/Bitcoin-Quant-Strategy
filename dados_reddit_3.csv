And guess what? Neither does gold, or apples, or lithium, or any other ""thing""

A commodity has no intrinsic value. It has market value, when referring to economic value rather than subjective value.

Every time we have a drop in price inevitably the buttcoiners, paper hands, inquisitive onlookers, etc will drop comments about how bitcoin has no intrinsic value. So here's a link to actually learn what that term means.

[Financial analysis uses cash flow to determine the intrinsic, or underlying, value of a company or stock. In options pricing, intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price of the option and the current market price of the underlying asset.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp#:~:text=Intrinsic%20value%20is%20a%20core,may%20be%20a%20smart%20investment.)

https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/intrinsic-value/

And guess what? That's a good thing. bitcoin isn't a company, it has no cash flows, it isn't split into stocks that generate dividends or produces products. It *is* the product.

This is because it's a commodity. The American government [agrees with this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2019-12/oceo_bitcoinbasics0218.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1qoWKnIT6AhUiATQIHZNUA8gQFnoECAIQBQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1C4pdX0CbJGLajzVMXUBrb)

The Canadian government [does as well](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.mondaq.com/advicecentre/content/3540/Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Taxation-in-Canada%23:~:text%3DAs%2520mentioned%252C%2520the%2520Canada%2520Revenue,commodity%2520is%2520exchanged%2520for%2520another.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBk7_gnIT6AhU3MTQIHeA3CH8QFnoECAUQBQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3b61bcBh-n0V4pnm9eicMr)

Even major nations who don't, still call it a currency such, as in the eu.

So ok, it's a commodity. But gold is better right? Well why?

If you take away golds history and we discovered it today what would it be worth? It's a shiny rock sure, we have lots of those, so as far as jewelry goes it would no longer have the same desirability. In fact it's use as jewelry and artifacts was specifically so that it could be flaunted or easily traded due to its value as money and a scarce metal. But these days we have platinum, far more valuable.

Well it doesn't tarnish! Well guess what, neither does platinum. And silver is extremely resistant to corrosion so while it does tarnish it is easy to clean and will still last the test of time.

Ok well it is great in electronics! Yeah no, it's less conductive than copper and silver. It's only redeemable quality is that it doesn't tarnish while still being decently conductive.

However we have better alternatives such as silver maxphase, even google has a patent on this tech now.

So really.. what value does gold have if we take away the historical context that still lingers in a nearly innate sense of longing we still have today to hoard it?

Really in the end other than some minor cosmetic, and electrical uses, and a few other side uses, all of which are basically replaceable, it's rarity and manufacturing expense is all that gives it value. However that can always change, asteroid mining, deposit discovery, these are both things that may threaten its future scarcity. With bitcoin we no the future scarcity, no question.

And really why would we want something that has potential uses to be used as money? Why would we want people to hoard and hide something that we may need out in the world for industrial use? (assuming all of my points were wrong and gold was incredibly useful).

bitcoin is good at being money. It's very very good at being money and nothing else should matter. It's language in a ledger, it's a comodity, it's value lies in the ability to safely, securely, and instantly hold it in trustless storage, to transact freely without permission, and to confirm for yourself where on the blockchain it is.

And for the argument that L2 is a secondary protocol that proves bitcoin isn't useful by itself. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, vinmo. These are essentially L2 built on top of the central banks ledger.

Speaking of, fiat has no intrinsic value. As we read in the first link, it can't because it doesn't generate it's own cash flows, it isn't a stock, hell it isn't even a commodity. It's barely even money, it's a currency that used to be backed by money (gold).

And finally what backs fiat? Oh its government backed. Really? The government refuses to accept taxes in any other form, forcing your income tax to be payed in fiat, forcing your purchases to be priced alongside the taxes. 

By the way even if how they back the dollar was legitimate, how ""backed"" is it? It loses value regularly, so ok the value of it isn't backed by them. It can be confiscated or you can be denied access to using it, some businesses don't even accept certain bills or any cash at all anymore! So a lot of good this ""backing by faith"" has done.

    America regularly forces country's to use their dollars as a form of international payments and settlements often through the imf, war, or coercion. They stole gold from other nations by essentially defaulting in 1971, but using loophole lingo to keep that one off the books, and forced those nations to accept their fiat by fiat.

The usd isn't backed by anything, it's coerced and enforced under punishment and threats. 

If something is valuable and desirable, why did it need to be enforced?

And besides that what backs gold? Silver? Platinum? Commodities don't need to be backed by anything, they simply are, and the free and open market can decide their value over time. Which is what we are seeing now. A highly fluctuating uncertain price discovery that is under heavy scrutiny and threat. But as a decentralized, non-physical commodity, they can't do jack. 

Like the black knight from Monty python, it's just a flesh wound, but this sucker can grow its limbs back.

So the price may go up, it may go down. Doesn't matter, it's a commodity I get to own and it's harder to steal and easier to use than anything that's ever come before.",For those who wonder at bitcoins intrinsic value and what it's backed by,0.71

Here is my idea instead engraving the actual words on the steel plate that someone can find. 

Pick a book, read it or skim through it, when you find your words: 

- Take down the page number
- Count the line where it's located
- Count where your word is in the line

So 
Page 11, Line 7, word 4
Page 23, Line 13, word 8
Etc. 

It all should look like this, 

`11, 7, 4`

`23, 13, 8`

`2, 12, 3`

`44, 2, 10`

etc...`

The whole point is to not tell a soul what book it is. Get the physical book with other books, buy it in person if possible, just try no to leave a paper or digital trail. People should read more. If someone finds your steel plate, the numbers are useless if they don't know what it is or what book it comes from. 📚 📖 🔑🤫

Edit: the PDF version of that edition is also an option. I keep private files in a VeraCrypt encrypted file in a USB stick. 

And yes there will always be issues with anything one comes up with like different book edition, you forget what book it is, etc. The point is to at least add another layer that's not too complicated for you but harder for someone else to figure out.

I understand the disincentives when it comes to bad actors looking to make a profit, this is convincing to me that it makes no sense and would be ridiculously financially damaging to any entity that attempted this. However...

I'm interested in the US or China attacking the network with a 51% attack, where their interest is to destroy bitcoin, not make a profit or gain any lasting control - and I'm focusing specifically about the proposed solution where a change of consensus protocol (from SHA256 to something else for instance) would be made to make the attackers ASICs worthless.

Wouldn't this destroy the hashing power securing the network by wiping out everyone elses ASICs as well, and make the Bitcoin network vulnerable to much cheaper attacks following the initial attack that results in us implementing the consensus change?

So an attack from US would be them burning billions of dollars to 51% attack the network, then we change consensus and they would attack a second time but utilising the new consensus, having to spend only a fraction, and then a third time, and a fourth time etc. Do we have an answer to this kind of attack?

In fact, this shift will probably accelerate the minute one of the central banks attempts one of the tyrannical controls they are lauding as benefits, like putting an expiration date or a cap on a particular good like energy.  We saw something similar in Canada with capital outflows the moment the government announced they will be freezing bank accounts.

Hi guys, I've started a new community call sats_for_deals where I (or anyone else)will be able to post daily deals e.g holidays deals, discount deals, reduce to clear deals with location etc or any deals you may come across when out and about doing daily stuff. Basically anything you think is a deal you can post on Sats_for_deals. How it will work is 1. Find a great deal (whether it be on the Internet or in store) 2. Post the deal on Sats_for_deals with a Sats wallet address 3. Anyone that finds the deal to be of some use and take up the deal can tip the wallet address some Sats whether it be 1 sat or 100 sats what ever you think the deal is worth you can tip. With inflation running hot and will continue to run hot it will be good to find a few daily deals that can save us a few pounds(I'm based in the U.K.) or dollars or what ever dirty fiat currency we can use to buy more Satoshis. So hope you guys join r/Sats_for_deals and lets grow the community together and let's start saving to buy more sats!! Thanks r/Bitcoin.","hi guys, check out r/sats_for_deals.

238,1662747884,False,"Seems like the propaganda narrative is being constructed to eventually argue against digital assets that use proof of work. 

So far we have inside and outside the US

1. No nuclear energy

2. Strong push for inferior / less reliable green alternatives 

3. Hindered development of fossil fuel sources, and rising energy costs

4. Power shortages, rationing, and blackouts in California

5. Laws with language that positions proof of work as possibly illegal or at least subject to onerous impossible regulation. 

So it would appear a perfect storm is brewing to make people suffer, cause a lot of anger, and then setup a direction to focus that anger. ie Proof of Work —&gt; bitcoin 

Even if bitcoin helps power grids stabilize and doesn’t use as much energy as football or Christmas lights, that won’t matter if you’ve rallied the people to be positioned against it. 

And certainly hash rate can move outside the US, but it would still hinder the market for a long time. And even then, these laws will extend to other countries. 

Not to mention regulations against exchanges to drop support for proof of work assets. 

Is what I described likely? If yes, what are the ways to pre-emptively fight back? Or the ways to avoid it all together.

And I emphasize, that laws and movements happen all the time based on false narratives. So it doesn’t need to be the case that it is true.

266,1662769991,False,"With Anthony Pompliano dropping his Bitcoin laser eyes from his Twitter profile, people have become very interested in whether or not he has dumped his BTC. I think this brings up a weakness in the BTC community.

Influencers like Pompliano and Michael Saylor being huge advocates for Bitcoin is a terrible reason for people to hold. This is not so different from being bullish on Meme stocks.

That said, it is speculated that the price of BTC would plummet if one of these influencers announced they had abandoned Bitcoin, and especially if many of them did. Getting rid of laser eyes suggests this without making them responsible for market manipulation. The price drop IMO, would be fine. I believe this would be a predominantly beneficial transfer of BTC, as those who hold for the sake of influencers and memes would be transferring to those who hold for the sake of fundamentals.

More BTC in the hands of those who hold for fundamentals is a good thing.

We've all seen addresses on websites or elsewhere intended to receive repeated transactions (i.e. tips, donations, etc.). I understand this is not a best practice for Bitcoin privacy: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address\_reuse](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse)

But lots of folks including many who are clearly familiar with Bitcoin privacy practices have static, public facing addresses to receive Bitcoin, and this seems like a reasonable use case.

In general, are they applying some other privacy measures, or are they just compromising on security to receive small donations/tips etc., with the knowledge that the relevant address/wallet is not fully private?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I believe that concerns over impending regulation are slightly overblown: there is not a clear route for the White House or any political administration to outright ban POW mining for everyone: if they do somehow manage to succeed, large mining pool companies will likely be the first to shut down. While this may have an impact on cryptoeconomic security in the short-term, it will ultimately further distribute the hashing power of the network over a broader network of individual miners. I also think that impending regulation has also promoted, at least somewhat, a sense of unity among cryptocurrency communities. Many prominent Bitcoin developers and advocates have spoken out against the banning of Tornado Cash by the US Government, while on the other hand, many alt-coin personalities have expressed their support for the right for Bitcoin to continue to using POW legally.",Thoughts on US regulation (good or bad?),0.62

From the perspective of governments doing bad things with your money, i'd say it's harder now that smart contracts are there. Everything is viewable for people to see.

There is an iOS/Android app called Polycam that can be used to acquire 3D models of a subject by stitching together lots of photographs. If somebody in Hungary could do this, I think a lot of Bitcoiners would appreciate it!

Unfortunately, the app requires that the subject be as non-reflective as possible, and the statue in Hungary is intentionally very reflective. Therefore, if anybody did acquire a 3D scan of the statue, they would probably first have to coat it in some material that is non-reflective and is also easily removable when the scan is completed.

The reason is that the very foundations of Bitcoin are embedded in its source code and cannot be manipulated by arbitrary decisions.

It is impossible to arbitrarily change the maximum supply of BTC arbitrarily. They cannot arbitrarily change the monetary policy of Bitcoin.

With Bitcoin, governments and central bankers can no longer manipulate the system. Bitcoin is truly the separation of money from the hands of the state.

And that's what scares the powerful in the current system. They are afraid of a system that gives power back to the people and gives everyone the same opportunities!

So don't be surprised to see these powerful people (falsely) denigrate Bitcoin on every possible subject. Ecology, money laundering, scams, criminal use of Bitcoin, ...

All clichés are used to scare the general public. The reason is that these powerful people want to avoid it at all costs so that the general public can think for themselves and finally understand that Bitcoin is our way out of a flawed and not fixable system.

A system that is fairer to the many and has the potential to change the world of the future for the better.

On your side, you have to make the only choice you can: think for yourself! Don't let others tell you what to think about Bitcoin.

Take charge of your life and do your own research on Bitcoin, money, and the economy.

Friedman, for example, viewed a pure gold standard as impractical. (...) if the growth of population or increase in trade outpaces the money supply, there would be no way to counteract deflation and reduced liquidity (and any attendant recession) except for the mining of MORE gold""* ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarism )


halving means: mining of LESS gold = STRONGLY reduced liquidity (strongly reduced number of transactions)

reduced mining + reduced transactions = network security in spiral of death

*** Q.E.D. ***

I'm sure at this point most of us already understand that fixing this Incoming Failure is a MUST.

""Bitcoin has a broken long-term security model"". Sad but true and not very surprising: if the initial edge case has inflation starting from infinity and marching to zero at the final edge case.

Surprising is something else... All of you asked - would probably answer that Bitcoin couldn't survive like ten years with steady, enormous inflation. But simultaneously - you try to convince each other that Bitcoin WILL perfectly survive whole decades in the second, neverending edge case. Surprising and funny.

Neverending **""free lunches""** for stakeholders - for which someone must pay. So, neverending heavy overtaxing daily users. And this tax is already calculable: at least $30 per transaction and only rising together with bitcoin price. 

And only DEFFERED in time. Pure, indisputable facts. There is no such thing as a free lunch. And that's so indisputable as the fact Bitcoin MUST be free of such ""free lunch"" cancer.

In the middle of Edge Case Bitcoin will die.


The only (unnamed) problem is: How to tell all these people after all these years - that Satoshi was wrong.

But Satoshi wasn't wrong. He was simply unable to properly predict when the Bitcoin ecosystem will reach the global saturation level.

But, his Child is so kind that it will show us what is the proper value for itself - of 'k' parameter for Friedman's k-percent rule. After several consecutive non-destructive halvings - we will see beginning of destructive ones (and four years observation period is long enough). Halvings will simply force Bitcoin to cross the area of proper 'k' value, going from upper levels to (destructive) sub-levels. This is quite obvious thing and point of no return. The point where a slight increase of reward every 210k blocks is necessary to keep Friedman's k-percent rule valid and annual inflation rate and **Security of the Network Constant**.

And there is no single reasonable explanation why painfully obvious Prisoner's Dilemma entitled: ""LMRA - Let Microstrategy Run Antminers"" (and burn money) - will be at this point suddenly suspended. The textbook example of prisoner's dilemma with embedded both: an **instant gratification** (instant removal of big costs) and **delayed punishment** (not fully recognized, even here - see comments below)

There is no such thing as **Game Theory suspension.**

and:

*""Nothing induces a bigger annoyance than the Truth""*


The only (uncomfortable) question is: Are we going to kill Satoshi's child?

Only because we have too much fear to say Satoshi was unable to predict something when Bitcoin was born? Only because we are paralised by this fear and we say nothing and do nothing? Would he be more proud of us:

a) if we fought so hard for his name that we killed his child by the way

b) if we rescued his child by implementing Milton Friedman's k-percent rule (at tiny price tag 0.1%/year)

The answer is obvious.

Milton Friedman was one of The Bitcoin Founding Fathers for Satoshi, if was talking about him:

*""The one thing that is missing but will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without them knowing each other.""* (1999)

Always better to have a rescue plan in case of: soon developed, then soon dying.

Always better safe than sorry.

Gold has been used as money for the most time in human history. It became the ultimate and most liquid reserve asset in the world and was used for commerce, saving and investment. The problem with gold that arose in modern times of international trade and the resulting number of transactions and especially the speed in which these transactions needed to be settled was the difficulty of physical transfer of ownership.

The solution was fiduciary custody of centralized third parties that enabled the transfer of ownership without moving the physical medium in itself. It was a mere act of accounting through which transactions could be settled fast enough to meet modern business requirements. But this came with a price of trust in the honesty of bookkeeping of mentioned fiduciary custody partners.

We all know how this ended in fractional reserve banking with all the consequences that we can still witness now. The gold backing was eroded away until gold was completely demonetized - or shall I say the paper bills were completely demonetized. 

The lack of gold backing is not the dollar’s problem per se but the expansion of the money supply that can be done with ease if no gold in reserves is required to do so. Gold is not the one money. It just met the criteria best to fulfill the requirements of an assumed perfect money.

Let’s think about a solution for gold’s problem of dishonest bookkeeping of the fiduciary custody entities. We can indulge in a thought experiment here when our problem is that we have no certainty about the gold when it’s locked away in dark vaults. Let’s assume we put every ounce of gold on the moon, visible in the night sky, each ounce with a number attached to it and an open ledger with the record of ownership for each coin. So everybody can see that each coin has only one owner and can also see with a telescope if his gold coin is still there. Let’s assume there is no spaceflight available in the near future that could enable bad parties to try and rob the coins.

We could then make transactions and publish the new record of ownership in the public ledger. 

You can probably already guess what we have created - a version of bitcoin with gold backing. But now it is quite easy to realize that we don’t really need these gold coins anymore. Since they would’ve been locked away in a dark vault or put visible for everyone on the moon - it makes no difference. We just fixed the supply of the money but we don’t need the backing anymore. Bitcoin achieved exactly this - proof of ownership for everyone visible.",Why Bitcoin solved gold's Problem and why we don't need gold,0.54

474,1662909005,False,"Hi all. 

Long story short, I think the US may be a sinking ship and I'd like to learn how to put money into BTC in prep for a move overseas. I would be liquidating real estate assets and then moving the money into crypto. 

I'm not looking for anything dodgy or gray area, all taxes will be paid, but its possible I may want to rapidly convert all my liquid assets into BTC, then leave the country should the politics here degrade much further. I realize that for me to have this as an option, I'll need to learn how its actually done and hear input from the people who know. 

So, please consider this scenario: You're a political dissident in an oppressive state. You just sold your home, liquidated your retirement accounts, sold your stocks and bonds. You have 3 big 6 figure checks checks from a brokerage, a title company and a bank. You have about 30K in cash assets from a local Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace/Estate sale of your physical belongings. Your objective is to put $700K in checks and $30K cash into BTC. 

How is this done, safely without anything gray area or with heightened risk?

500,1662923575,False,"    I'll start off by saying bitcoin is very interesting. I own a good amount of it. And I love the movement. I do have some criticisms. Just because I own some and like it and so do a lot of other people doesn't mean its perfect and I like to go through things with a fine tooth comb to find flaws.
How do we acquire bitcoin in a cbdc world when everything is tracked?
    Its no longer a conspiracy that the world is moving to cbdc with a digital ID that is tied to some sort of social scoring system like esg. In this system I'm sure in order to partake in society you would need this new ID in order to use this new cbdc which all businesses would be ordered to use and probably wouldn't be allowed to use anything else. Since bitcoin is easily traceable I don't see how it would survive governments who will trace down these transactions and possibly jail people and close businesses for using it. Now this is a what if but if the government wants us to use cbdc only then I'm sure they will use their power to fight off bitcoin. Yes there are mixers and you can buy p2p but we know still it can be traced albeit it takes a lot of time and skill. 
    
    Secondly I'm also thinking about how the internet can be taken away. If say the government cracks down and forces internet providers to collect all data and block sites that have anything to do with bitcoin. What would we use to transfer our bitcoin and make trancriticisms And if we refuse to take this new ID and cbdc how do we even purchase bitcoin? Even if we do take this new id and cbdc our transactions can be blocked. If the only way to pay internet companies is to use cbdc then how do we get around this? In a world of cbdc how do we even acquire bitcoin when your transactions are tracked and can be blocked? I get some people have used radio waves but we still need the internet to use the network as a whole for the nodes and miners and the people who use their phones to pay with bitcoin. Who really knows how to use radio waves? Bitcoin is already mildly confusing but to then make it only usable on radio waves makes it almost too difficult for people to use.
    
    To finish my criticisms. I like the movement and the people behind bitcoin. You all truly want freedom and change and power back to people and I commend that and that's why I own bitcoin. But I do see so many issues that have yet to come but will more than likely come. Government isn't our friend and they will make war against people. With bitcoin being digital comes with many great strengths but also has many weaknesses. I wonder sometimes if gold and other metals and commodities are the real way to fight the problem. In a world where you are tracked digitally wouldn't a untraceable valuable metal be used instead? We can buy gold and other commodities straight from people without letting anyone know we own it. We can find it naturally on earth using manual labor which is another reason why its valuable we are using actual labor. We can bury these things or even wear them or hide them in places no one would expect. People will always accept it aswell. I know for a fact I would. Yes there's a lot of gold in space but we havent reached that point yet and that's one thing that's brought up against it but it still doesn't take away the fact its a very useful resource that's been used for ages under governments that were way more authoritarian than today and it worked. I believe bitcoin as the idea itself is amazing. But I believe the way to fight our current issues is to carry physical cash and to have useful commodities not just gold but other commodities and food. We can't eat gold or bitcoin or dollars so storing food is also very important and starting a mini garden or farm. Thank you for your time!",My only criticisms of bitcoin,0.53

667,1663009606,False,"Fidelity Investments is weighing a plan to allow individual investors to trade bitcoin on its brokerage platform, people familiar with the matter said, marking the financial giant’s latest foray into cryptocurrencies. 

Fidelity launched a bitcoin-trading business for hedge funds and other institutional investors in 2018, and earlier this year allowed corporate clients to add the digital asset to the 401(k) retirement plans it manages for them. Now, the Boston firm is working toward bringing crypto to its more than 34.4 million brokerage accounts, the people said. 

Led by its chief executive, Abigail Johnson, Fidelity was among the first mainstream financial firms to champion digital assets and the technology that underpins them. Ms. Johnson began holding weekly crypto discussions with her lieutenants nearly a decade ago, and in 2015 Fidelity started mining bitcoin. Later, it added a link on retail customers’ accounts to Coinbase, the crypto exchange, to track their holdings. In 2020, it opened its own crypto fund for wealthy customers. 

When Fidelity opened its 401(k) accounts to bitcoin, industry executives came to believe it was only a matter of time before the firm moved to allow brokerage customers to hold crypto in their accounts. Some of its competitors, including Robinhood Markets Inc., have used access to digital assets as a key selling point for a new generation of investors who had started trading everything from stocks and options to bitcoin in 2020. 

On Monday, Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Holdings Ltd.’s CEO and one of Fidelity’s first crypto clients, signaled Fidelity would soon join them. 

“A bird told me that Fidelity, a little bird in my ear, is going to shift their retail customers into crypto soon enough,” Mr. Novogratz said during a speech at the SALT Conference. “I hope that bird is right. And so we are seeing this institutional march.”

Fidelity hasn’t shared its plans with its clients yet.

Anything Fidelity does to expand crypto’s reach to individual investors is likely to draw scrutiny from Washington. The U.S. Department of Labor has said it was concerned about companies’ decisions to allow its employees to invest in cryptocurrencies through their Fidelity retirement plans. Several U.S. senators have also raised questions about the plan, citing the risks inherent investing savings in such risky assets.

**The Difficulty Adjustment** is the **great missing innovation** that made Bitcoin work.  

While it ensures that Bitcoin's **supply** is **predictable** it also is a:  

* fundamental **security** **mechanism** 
* **self**\-**regulating** mechanism  
* crucial **consensus** **component**   


Since its inception Bitcoin adjusted its difficulty 373 times.  

For the 1st year of its existence, the difficulty did not increase, the 1st ""big"" change taking place on 2010-01-01 \~ block 32,256.  

The biggest changes are: - upwards being 302%  - downwards 27%

https://preview.redd.it/y3b65b0ojnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d22f3e7239ddb379ede231518d02b6ed519a1d

The Bitcoin Difficulty tells us how hard it is to find a hash that will make for a valid block.  

At the current difficulty of 30,977,051,760,460  1 in every 

13,315,579,227,696,403,823,071,581 SHA256 hash will be a valid block.    
Valid means below a certain target.

https://preview.redd.it/yy283chpjnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3345aa778de87a32655cf28991428676307c9911

Mining is a random and unpredictable process. 

Even more so miners can leave and join the network at any time.    
Both factors can influence how fast blocks come.  

The difficulty regulates the speed at which new blocks are added on to the blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

The adjustment: 

1. Maintains a consistent issuance of new bitcoins.  
2. Ensures further that the incentives of the miners are aligned with the users and keep them honest.    

Point #2 will explained further.  


Miners hash all the block data with a random nonce until they find a block hash that is smaller than a certain Target.  

There is a direct relation between Target and Difficulty.  

The smaller the target, the harder it is to mine.

https://preview.redd.it/scqztkxrjnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a18798359f102a4b618f9ba6d03d5fabe69944d1

The Target number is stored in a block in the field Bits in a compressed format.  

The fact that the Target itself is hashed with the rest of the block data makes the difficulty forgery-proof.\*  

The Difficulty is usually presented in decimal format.

https://preview.redd.it/8frjxv0tjnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=036db932ca0e5ffa29c06136c43ecbda5db7113d

Target = Max Target / Difficulty  

Max Target: the target, if difficulty is 1 (lowest possible difficulty)  

This value was picked by Satoshi.   
Both Max Target and Difficulty 1 were hardcoded in the genesis block by him.  


https://preview.redd.it/wij6le2ujnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6860757c8176b9338c46f66a0b9e6bf8286deca9

A difficulty of 420, means that it will take 420 more tries(on average) to find a valid hash than with the easiest difficulty of 1.  

As mentioned The Genesis Block started with difficulty 1.  

Ever since every 2016 blocks, the Difficulty is recalculated.

&amp;#x200B;

When a block is mined, the miner also needs to add a timestamp to the block.  

This Timestamp is used to recalculate the difficulty each time.  

We want a new block to be found \~10 minutes, so after 2016 blocks we check what was the time between blocks.

https://preview.redd.it/v3l4231xjnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4bd7e1d87cb43d40c3db380ab8c906c6018da41

Expected time: 2016 blocks x 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes.  

If the blocks were generated faster, let's say 8 minutes, then we get 2016 x 9 = 18,144  20160 / 16128 = 1.25  

New Difficulty = 1.25 \* Old Difficulty

&amp;#x200B;

The hashrate is NOT known!   
We just know how fast blocks are generated.  

We use the timestamps in blocks to estimate how much hash rate is working on the network. 

This is not really an exact science.  

But the timestamps themselves are not exact science.

https://preview.redd.it/5hmx7qbyjnn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d2f2189bf0f059a5f390237a9db63f7b76ea361

As mentioned we need some reference of time in order to make sure we adjust for a block to come every 10 minutes.  

When a block is mined the miner adds the time inside.  

But what if he has the wrong time or he is lying?  

Why would miners lie?  
To get more coins!  


It is in the miner's interest to say that blocks took longer to produce.  

This will have the effect of lowering the next difficulty.    
Lower difficulty -&gt; easier to mine coins.  

To mitigate this attack Bitcoin has 3 rules:  


**MedianPast Time Rule** \- a node will NOT accept a block unless it has a timestamp greater than the median of the previous 11 blocks.  

This is a consensus rule.   
If not satisfied, blocks are rejected.    
[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L259](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L259)

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/bgrtpw60knn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60f76dddcbe09d7eefb503212e22db5d5e4ab7d9)

Future Block Time Rule - The time stamp can NOT be more than 2 hours relative to the median time from the node’s peers  

`MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME` \- is used.  

This is a policy rule.   
Blocks from the future can become valid in the future.   
 [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L22)

&amp;#x200B;

The maximum allowed gap between the time provided by the nodes and the local system clock is 90 minutes.  

This is a local client rule.

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L38n](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L38n)

https://preview.redd.it/t1yki7c6knn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd94f65d52c32050925976358bd0fc858a8563d

**Rule #1** \-  ensures that the blockchain **advances forward**.  

Rule #2 - ensures that the chain does **not move too forward**.  

Rule #3 is an **extra** **safeguard**.  

Most importantly these rules tell us that **managing time in** **Bitcoin** is **very hard** and **imprecise**.  


Even though the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, it only takes into account 2015 blocks.  

This is because Satoshi introduced a off-by-1 bug.

[https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree//trunk/main.cpp#l689](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree//trunk/main.cpp#l689)  

This is still present in the code today, as fixing it could result in a hard-fork.

https://preview.redd.it/zydqyyc8knn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18d56088e243d3fffd114626c9b77a159bbb2fc2

Instead of checking how much time has passed between the last blocks of each 2016 period, the code compares the time between the 1st and the 2016th block of each period.  

Between 2016 things there are 2015 gaps.

https://preview.redd.it/dpq48cfaknn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3fdcd0e287ac8ba7d32b98c9a045bc474b76fe

As a consequence Blocks are NOT actually 10 minutes, but 10.005 minutes.  

The 0.3 seconds are not a big deal but bug allows for 2 very weird things to occur.📷  


You may expect retargeting interval to be (2 weeks)/2015, but it is even weirder.  

If the Bitcoin hash rate is perfectly constant, and blocks have exact timestamps the difficulty would adjust once every 2 weeks, 20 minutes, 1.191658seconds.  

As Pieter Wuille points out [https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1098651788343955456](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1098651788343955456)  
  

The 2nd effect is the Time Warp Attack.  

Given the rules mentioned above:  

*  Block Timestamp &gt; median of prev 11 blocks   
*  Block Timestamp &lt; now + some buffer  

Within these rules, a miner could lie that it took longer to generate blocks.

https://preview.redd.it/rv2x2jzbknn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e66a14fd51c1ea67b2286a852661078ee70053

The off-by-1 one makes the last block of the current period to not overlap with the 1st block of new period.  

An attacker could do this indefinitely and bring the difficulty to 1.  

However, this attack would be very visible and would require miner coordination from miners.

 

Besides the temporal restrictions, the difficulty can not change by more than a factor of 4.  

This seems quite a peculiar restriction but it serves a good purpose.  

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/pow.cpp#L54](https://t.co/hIK8JJW9bv)

https://preview.redd.it/g8a21kaeknn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6705c070424ca2ecece68d66b564b079bbb22638

This rule further protects against the attack mentioned. 

Also, it is possible to isolate a node from the network and send it blocks with false time stamps.  

The node would be tricked into lowering its difficulty and the attacker will be able to create false blocks easier.  


https://preview.redd.it/jxo2pgmfknn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5215174b6085e91b07c5f030240865e49e61665

Why 2016 blocks? 2 weeks / 10 minutes = 2016  

Why not less than 2016? 

It would allow for similar isolating attacks as explained above.  

An attacker can isolate a node, and send it blocks with lower difficulty.    
Any similar attacks, to succeed needs to keep up for 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you an idea of how difficult current times are. 

My Apple M1 Max computer does 5.8Mhashes/s.   
It would take me 727 million years to find a block at the current difficulty.  

Thymos in 2010 ""generated 5 blocks"" on a Pentium processor. (1000 times slower than mine)  


https://preview.redd.it/ehgfvnbhknn91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c830c5d0dfcb2e24085bd26498cb4e7af673b853

Having a Difficulty Adjustment and even more adding these restrictions in order to eliminate these attacks was visionary.  

Never mind the fact we never had something like this before.  

IF anything this shows us how untrustworthy/ineffective Bitcoin at time management.  


Maybe why timechain was replaced with blockchain  

As we can see from this comment in the Bitcoin Client released by Satoshi, was hoping add NTP.  

NTP - is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer system.

812,1663098742,False," I regularly try all different types of trading apps and this time it was Bitpay, so I’ll give you a quick run through and I would also like to hear your thoughts.

This non-custodial app can be used to trade fiat for BTC. As a mobile app, it allows the user to continue without signing up, logging in or selecting a username.

When asked to either create a key or import a key, I opted for a new one. Although it means having to store a new key, I personally feel an extra sense of security with a freshly generated key. Another layer made available is the ability to encrypt your key, preventing any unauthorised users from accessing your wallet.

I can also appreciate the app highlighting the importance of owning our own keys and keeping them safe, this is especially important to stress for those new to the industry. 

The UI is simple enough: buy, swap, sell and view your portfolio with the option to pair your Coinbase account (I haven’t used Coinbase yet).

Buying offers are provided by Wyre and Simplex, from what I understand they are both external companies who have partnered with Bitpay, the user is directed from the app to one of these platforms to complete an offer.

Upon selecting Simplex, the site asks for a few details. If you are uncomfortable with providing your card details, full name, address, email and phone number then your journey ends here my friend.

After confirming the trade amount, I was asked to upload identification documents for verification this could either be a passport, ID Card or drivers license (for a trade of 100USD). I think allowing the user to go through all those previous steps to finalise with KYC is a little misleading for those who are not comfortable with giving such information but if you don’t mind, it’s your bog standard KYC.

**TLDR: A non custodial app used to buy, sell and swap crypto with fiat, where users own their own keys. Bitpay provides a simple user journey with the ability to link to a Coinbase account. Before trade is complete, users should expect a last minute KYC prompt from the app’s external partners.**

1. What would incentives “cheese makers” to invest into their craft instead of BTC?  How would you go about allocating that $100M as a CHZ exec?

2. If majority of $$$ would then go to BTC instead of expanding cheese making business - would that slow down or negatively impact the robustness of “cheese supply” for the world in the short term (prior to majority of inflationary money entering Bitcoin pool)?

Hi guys, I've started a new community call sats\_for\_deals where I (or anyone else)will be able to post daily deals e.g holidays deals, discount deals, reduce to clear deals with location etc or any deals you may come across when out and about doing daily stuff. Basically anything you think is a deal you can post on Sats\_for\_deals. How it will work is 1. Find a great deal (whether it be on the Internet or in store) 2. Post the deal on Sats\_for\_deals with a Sats wallet address 3. Anyone that finds the deal to be of some use and take up the deal can tip the wallet address some Sats whether it be 1 sat or 100 sats what ever you think the deal is worth you can tip. With inflation running hot and will continue to run hot it will be good to find a few daily deals that can save us a few pounds(I'm based in the U.K.) or dollars or what ever dirty fiat currency we can use to buy more Satoshis. So hope you guys join [r/Sats\_for\_deals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sats_for_deals/) and lets grow the community together and let's start saving to buy more sats!!

The reason this comes to my mind is I was just reading the description of ""Taro"" from the recent post here and the discussion about whether or not a ""decentralized stablecoin"" should be created with it.

What will most likely happen is lightning will proliferate as a better value transfer protocol than Visa Mastercard and Swift. There will be API services that allow merchants to accept lightning invoices and instantly receive dollars into their business bank account. Banks will plug into lightning APIs allowing their app users to scan and pay lightning invoices using their dollar balance. Businesses and individuals will still use banks but money flows and transactions will happen over lightning instead of through Visa and Mastercard.

This is fine because this is how 99% of the world will become bitcoin users without even knowing it, they will be using bitcoin everytime they transact.

The fun part of this is that once all merchants are accepting lightning invoices and all banks are plugged into lightning, us bitcoiners will be able to use bitcoin over lightning to pay for everything everywhere on earth. At that point it really will be possible to be your own bank becuase your lightning wallet will now be accepted at more places than Visa and Mastercard. There will be no difference in a users payment experience between a free lightning wallet loaded with sats or a banking app loaded with dollars.

Then and only then will the other 99% who are uninterested in bitcoin be able to actually decide to start getting paid in bitcoin and start saving in bitcoin with a lightning wallet rather than holding dollars in a bank.

99% of the world is not going to accept bitcoin, but lightning is the trojan horse that will lead to every merchant on earth accepting bitcoin without even knowing it.

The way that bankers arbitrarily raise and lower the price of debt is never questioned in the media narrative of supposedly capitalist nations. But this is the last great state monopoly rigged market and it rigs the price of capital itself. For over 30 years central banks steadily lowered the price of debt/capital inflating asset prices and disguising and depriving the efficiencies gained by globalisation and technology. We were told there was no inflation but huge reductions in the cost of many goods and services were stolen from the consumer via debasement.

Now trade is disrupted by pandemic and war - Russia and China are challenging the global order.

Convention dictates high inflation be responded to by increasing the price of money thereby reducing demand and lowering prices. But the high quantity and low quality of debt accumulated threatens to result in mass defaults if the price of debt is raised too high.

Potential pitfalls / exploits:              
1) I think a few of these mining ops would look at the situation and think, ""Wow, we have a new energy source. We can use this and our coal energy source to add more hashrate instead of scaling down our coal.""              
2) Maybe some of these companies would look at the situation and think, ""Why on Earth should we accept this? Aren't we a big strong company? We don't need this kind of charity!""              
3) Some other situation I might not have foreseen.             

Thoughts?               

EDIT: I'm not ignorant of the fact that bitcoin takes advantage of stranded energy (solar gas flare mining, methane-gas flare mining, decommissioned hydro-power plants, etc.). However, it's just that there will always be outlier cases and countries where it's cheaper to use coal than solar, wind, and in some cases, nuclear.",Is there a level of altruism if we come together as a community and decide to use bitcoin to fund green energy mining for big mining companies that aren't green?,0.4

First heard about it in 2013. Thought it was a fad then, then in 2016 I saw it was still around and reconsidered my uneducated decision of it “being a fad”, after having been working as a tech analyst for a while, learning to judge based on facts and data instead of baseless emotions thanks to the lessons I learned from my job.

Studied it more to make a decision based on facts and data, learned about the financial system thanks to it, and started a $50 dollar a week DCA.

An amount of money I wasted weekly on beer, cigarettes, or fast food anyway that would get me no where in life with those habits.

Cut back on that stuff to start my DCA(dollar cost average), calculating that if my analysis was wrong, then it was money I would’ve spent anyway.

Glad I made the bet too, because thanks to it I got a multi six figure savings and my family isn’t suffering from this hellish inflation most are suffering from today.

Also learned of its convenience when my banks over the years failed me, and my self custody’d Bitcoin would be the solution. 

Was like the early days of the internet when the post office failed me but email would save me.

Today, I keep that dollar cost average conversion of my fiat savings into a ₿Itcoin savings going, but at a rate where I no longer wish to keep dollars I don’t plan to hold for 5 years or more. Because I’ve learned since then that ₿Itcoin is money that can’t be stopped. Aka permission-less. 

Meaning, should shit hit the fan and banks block access like Celsius, Voyager, and Lebanese banks have, then I rather have my money in Bitcoin via a cold storage wallet I control to do whatever I want with or move wherever I want with it, than risk having it get locked away from my control by a 3rd party custodian, where they can potentially keep my money inaccessible me when I need it most.",My Bitcoin story started in 2016.

The marketing could include a Superbowl commercial/World Cup/other big events for broad coverage, guerilla marketing, and whatever else some smart marketing gurus there are in the bitcoin reddit community can think up.

A better product doesn't get in the hands of consumers without marketing.

With the addition of more local markets, it is realistic to live only on bitcoin as a local.  We make it a point to always shop with our vendors, so our fiat usage is near zero at this point.

Our crew of gig workers are paid in bitcoin, some cash out a little to fiat. However, some sell us fiat to get ""pouch money"" because it is easier to remit to their family in other cities with bitcoin.

The thing is, five years ago I’ve created around 50 paper wallets (very safely) and since then I’ve been sending my coins to these wallets in a way that no wallet holds more than USD50k. I store the keys away from my home and also keep a copy of these wallets safely stored on a second location (actually in another country) and in all these years my private keys were never exposed to the internet (the wallets were generated offline and the old computer and old printer were physically destroyed). So yes the paper wallets are safe. But keeping such amount with the perspective of one day each paper wallet to hold hundreds of thousands of dollars is making me nervous, I fear the day I’ll finally have to sweep one of those wallets in order to spend the money and something goes wrong for whatever reason. Even sweeping everything to a hardware wallet right now makes me anxious not to mention not trusting putting all my BTCs under a single mnemonic seed instead of having multiple wallets as I have right now. I know I’m being paranoid, but it’s not easy to have such a big part of your savings on something that can be easily stolen from you. I guess that with great power comes great responsibility.

So here is a simple but useful calculation to use when estimating a long term price:

&amp;#x200B;

***For every 5% of the entire world’s wealth you believe will flow into / be stored in Bitcoin, give Bitcoin‘s price $1,000,000.***

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if we see large flows from real estate, bonds and stocks into Bitcoin over the next 20 years, and Bitcoin captures \~10% of the world’s wealth storage long term - that will result in a Bitcoin price of $2,000,000.

Similarly, a model of \~20% global wealth held in Bitcoin over the next two decades would result in a Bitcoin price of $4,000,000 by \~2042 (this is what I personally believe to be the case).

&amp;#x200B;

\--

The math behind this for those that are interested:

The total amount of global wealth is currently estimated to be 420 Trillion dollars ($420000000000000).

$420000000000000 divided by 21,000,000 bitcoins = $20,000,000 per Bitcoin in today’s dollars (the price of Bitcoin if all of the worlds wealth was in Bitcoin).

$20,000,000 x 5% = $1,000,000

1411,1663514784,False,"I have used Trezor in the past and here is an overview of the product in my perspective. Maybe it could help future users or encourage feedback from current users.

Trezor offers a secure hardware wallet compatible with multiple coins including BTC. With Trezor, you own your own keys, stored on the device only. The device is built on a single chip base, this narrows the attack surface by limiting points of interception (aka, tricky to hack).

Connected via micro USB for the original model or USB-C for the newer Trezor Model T, the device is primarily used in connection with the desktop companion app called Trezor Suite. 

The app offers a simple to use GUI allowing me to manage wallets as well as to buy, sell or trade BTC. I also have the ability to view my portfolio, check my incoming and outgoings, create and rename unlimited wallets, adjust security settings and other options. 

The original model has two buttons and a screen while the updated Model T is a touch screen. The screen displays messages prompting the user to confirm all transactions and notifies when the passcode is required during different points of the journey. Unfortunately, there is no Trezor mobile app as of yet and although the device can be connected through a cable with Android devices, it does not support IOS. 

No internet connection is required to view my portfolio which gives me complete control over my assets, similar to keeping cash in a safe at home.

 Could you let me know about your experience using the device?",Thoughts on the Trezor wallet?,0.78

*Amount traded here (using LocalBitcoin only) dropped from 38 to 32 BTC this week. Around 8% of the worldwide trade there (408 BTC).*

*Why LocalBitcon? It's the only exchange that post its stats. It is not the most used or popular anymore, that is for sure. People use Binance (king), AirTM, Reserve and others.*

*One BTC is around 160,000 Bs. -Bolivar, our currency- (Missing some zeroes? Government removed by law 6 zeroes last year, third time doing it, first 3 zeroes in 2007 and 5 in 2018, one ""current"" bolivar would be 100,000,000,000,000 Bs. before 2007).*

*Yes, MONTHLY minimum wage is 16 USD. 130 Bs. and exchange rate is 8:1. According to a NGO 52% of the Venezuelan worker earn less than 100 USD monthly*

*Average should be around that, 100 USD monthly.*

*Another NGO says you need 500 USD monthly only for basic necesities for a 5 members family and I think it's short considering last month inflation.*

*People use crypto to pay in some places, to save (BTC is more stable than Bolivares) using or not stablecoins, Binance allows you to purchase crypto with Bolivares and sell your crypto for Bolivares, remittances is also a way of using crypto people from abroad send money to their families here and also miners, electricity is free so big mining operations here (even GPU mining still gives you something here even after the merge).*

This is really expensive here in the States, so I got connected to a shop on Delhi by my hairdresser who is a woman originally from India. .  

I connect with the shop owner via WhatsApp, she is excited that I am the first foreigner to purchase items from her shop. I send her my measurements, we confirm the saree pieces I am purchasing, and now I need to pay. There is no feasible way for me to do a bank transfer so I go to Western Union -- send $200, pay $11 in fees. Fine. 

A week goes by she tells me that her husband went to the Western Union, and this particular Western Union in Delhi only has a license to receive money from Indian Nationals. They cannot obtain my money from Western Union. We try a bank transfer again, not possible. Another week goes by. 

I tell this woman that I can pay her instantly via Bitcoin. I try to educate her on it -- would have been a much better story to share here if I could have convinced her. She's not willing to do it. 

In the end, I ended up sending money to my hairdresser, who sent the money to her brother in India, and her brother in India paid for the shop for me. The whole thing took 3 weeks. It's 2022, this scenario should never be ""the norm"". Hopefully, I planted a seed for the shop, and if I purchase from her again, I am going to tell her that I will only do it if it is in Bitcoin.","Wishing Bitcoin was the norm, buying sarees in India",0.73

Every user on onboarding gets his/her own IBAN account (internally) and all the external bank withdrawals happen to form your IBAN account created in your name and hence safe.

**The Difficulty Adjustment** is the **great missing innovation** that made Bitcoin work.

While it ensures that Bitcoin's **supply** is **predictable** it also is a:

* fundamental **security** **mechanism**
* **self**\-**regulating** mechanism
* crucial **consensus** **component**

Since its inception Bitcoin adjusted its difficulty 373 times.

For the 1st year of its existence, the difficulty did not increase, the 1st ""big"" change taking place on 2010-01-01 \~ block 32,256.

The biggest changes are: - upwards being 300% - downwards 25%

https://preview.redd.it/r132t9veyzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ac3d95611047db61d63c14052ccafd5e225891

The Bitcoin Difficulty tells us how hard it is to find a hash that will make for a valid block.

At the current difficulty of 30,977,051,760,460 1 in every

13,315,579,227,696,403,823,071,581 SHA256 hash will be a valid block.  
Valid means below a certain target.

https://preview.redd.it/5q947wdiyzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f964aacc9f0648d4d0ca02dfc1385449fb73b5d3

Mining is a random and unpredictable process.

Even more so miners can leave and join the network at any time.  
Both factors can influence how fast blocks come.

The difficulty regulates the speed at which new blocks are added on to the blockchain.

The adjustment:

1. Maintains a consistent issuance of new bitcoins.
2. Ensures further that the incentives of the miners are aligned with the users and keep them honest.

Point #2 will be explained further.

Miners hash all the block data with a random nonce until they find a block hash that is smaller than a certain Target.

There is a direct relation between Target and Difficulty.

The smaller the target, the harder it is to mine.

https://preview.redd.it/ksu07v1kyzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f90a6e8ba1d7a8039f759d042e63e1638b9b5c88

The Target number is stored in a block in the field Bits in a compressed format.

The fact that the Target itself is hashed with the rest of the block data makes the difficulty forgery-proof.\*

The Difficulty is usually presented in decimal format.

https://preview.redd.it/pjk1pl2myzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f15417462988861eb773a26715751b52c7240b96

Target = Max Target / Difficulty

Max Target: the target, if difficulty is 1 (lowest possible difficulty)

This value was picked by Satoshi.  
Both Max Target and Difficulty 1 were hardcoded in the genesis block by him.

https://preview.redd.it/q8naxh4nyzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6defeba74987e29e277044f8b413b5dc19119c33

A difficulty of 420, means that it will take 420 more tries(on average) to find a valid hash than with the easiest difficulty of 1.

As mentioned The Genesis Block started with difficulty 1.

Ever since every 2016 blocks, the Difficulty is recalculated.

When a block is mined, the miner also needs to add a timestamp to the block.

This Timestamp is used to recalculate the difficulty each time.

We want a new block to be found \~10 minutes, so after 2016 blocks we check what was the time between blocks.

Expected time: 2016 blocks x 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes.

If the blocks were generated faster, let's say 8 minutes, then we get 2016 x 9 = 18,144 20160 / 16128 = 1.25

New Difficulty = 1.25 \* Old Difficulty

The hashrate is NOT known!  
We just know how fast blocks are generated.

We use the timestamps in blocks to estimate how much hash rate is working on the network.

This is not really an exact science.

But the timestamps themselves are not an exact science.

https://preview.redd.it/beci1j5pyzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bea046aa1ec689e03c17b0715e2552a535bdda11

As mentioned we need some reference of time in order to make sure we adjust for a block to come every 10 minutes.

When a block is mined the miner adds the time inside.

But what if he has the wrong time or he is lying?

Why would miners lie?  
To get more coins!

It is in the miner's interest to say that blocks took longer to produce.

This will have the effect of lowering the next difficulty.  
Lower difficulty -&gt; easier to mine coins.

To mitigate this attack Bitcoin has 3 rules:

1. **MedianPast Time Rule** \- a node will NOT accept a block unless it has a timestamp greater than the median of the previous 11 blocks.

This is a consensus rule.  
If not satisfied, blocks are rejected.  
[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L259](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L259)

2. Future Block Time Rule - The timestamp can NOT be more than 2 hours relative to the median time from the node’s peers

MAX\_FUTURE\_BLOCK\_TIME \- is used.

This is a policy rule.  
Blocks from the future can become valid in the future.  
[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L22)

3. The maximum allowed gap between the time provided by the nodes and the local system clock is 90 minutes.

This is a local client rule.

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L38n](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4daadce36cfe9baa63c4d7d70de027add03a00df/src/chain.h#L38n)

https://preview.redd.it/0p7pdwj1zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046090f30b6e3575d35a74e518a9621b29ccdb5a

**Rule #1** \- ensures that the blockchain **advances forward**.

Rule #2 - ensures that the chain does **not move too forward**.

Rule #3 is an **extra** **safeguard**.

Most importantly these rules tell us that **managing time in** **Bitcoin** is **very hard** and **imprecise**.

Even though the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, it only takes into account 2015 blocks.

This is because Satoshi introduced a off-by-1 bug.

[https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree//trunk/main.cpp#l689](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree//trunk/main.cpp#l689)

This is still present in the code today, as fixing it could result in a hard-fork.

https://preview.redd.it/oncohtt2zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4be560030abdc8b526f0a1db901bb9b8bce6289c

Instead of checking how much time has passed between the last blocks of each 2016 period, the code compares the time between the 1st and the 2016th block of each period.

Between 2016 things there are 2015 gaps.

https://preview.redd.it/tgimxrv3zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e23d29788ee95024fad226655bde8c8c13530e7

As a consequence Blocks are NOT actually 10 minutes, but 10.005 minutes.

The 0.3 seconds are not a big deal but bug allows for 2 very weird things to occur.📷

You may expect retargeting interval to be (2 weeks)/2015, but it is even weirder.

If the Bitcoin hash rate is perfectly constant, and blocks have exact timestamps the difficulty would adjust once every 2 weeks, 20 minutes, 1.191658seconds.

As Pieter Wuille points out [https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1098651788343955456](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1098651788343955456)

The 2nd effect is the Time Warp Attack.

Given the rules mentioned above:

* Block Timestamp &gt; median of prev 11 blocks
* Block Timestamp &lt; now + some buffer

Within these rules, a miner could lie that it took longer to generate blocks.

https://preview.redd.it/ydvy84w4zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b78c13d73a6383d75a8e7999c0ac7051a7437c90

The off-by-1 one makes the last block of the current period to not overlap with the 1st block of new period.

An attacker could do this indefinitely and bring the difficulty to 1.

However, this attack would be very visible and would require miner coordination from miners.

Besides the temporal restrictions, the difficulty can not change by more than a factor of 4.

This seems quite a peculiar restriction but it serves a good purpose.

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/pow.cpp#L54](https://t.co/hIK8JJW9bv)

https://preview.redd.it/bfx76eq6zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28435c9118d203d315bf32ee29dfd339f9c01be4

This rule further protects against the attack mentioned.

Also, it is possible to isolate a node from the network and send it blocks with false time stamps.

The node would be tricked into lowering its difficulty and the attacker will be able to create false blocks easier.

https://preview.redd.it/jucxclx7zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa25bf0c809d6ba5605181347a1505c162aa4ca

Why 2016 blocks? 2 weeks / 10 minutes = 2016

Why not less than 2016?

It would allow for similar isolating attacks as explained above.

An attacker can isolate a node, and send it blocks with lower difficulty.  
Any similar attacks, to succeed needs to keep up for 2 weeks.

To give you an idea of how difficult current times are.

My Apple M1 Max computer does 5.8Mhashes/s.  
It would take me 727 million years to find a block at the current difficulty.

Thymos in 2010 ""generated 5 blocks"" on a Pentium processor. (1000 times slower than mine)

https://preview.redd.it/aah7mqx8zzo91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f0e06a2598b4fd4cbe17afee1cdfc5b5057cb9

Having a Difficulty Adjustment and even more adding these restrictions in order to eliminate these attacks was visionary.

Never mind the fact we never had something like this before.

IF anything this shows us how untrustworthy/ineffective Bitcoin at time management.

Maybe why timechain was replaced with blockchain

As we can see from this comment in the Bitcoin Client released by Satoshi, was hoping add NTP.

NTP - is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer system.  
This never happened.

Millions of investors invest in it and the total collected so far is Rs. 31,290 crores (approx 4 billion dollars). Even if it is 400 billion, it will not have any impact on the gold price as there is no real gold bought against this. It is only a notional reserve.

Grocery prices will be in sats, paid in sats but all only theoretically adding and subtracting sats from one account to another without actually holding or transferring BTC? Sure the price will be based on BTC dollar value but only theoretically tracked. Not actual bitcoin.

Infact today the fiat is that way. I have an entry against my account number and I pay someone, the amount is deducted here and added there. No actual money transfer.

1676,1663695285,False,"I have been thinking about this for a while. Usually comments from shitcoiners about bitcoin centralization made me think about this.

As I see it, bitcoin has the following parts:

1) The codebase: Id say this is the most decentralized part of bitcoin. With developers all around the world working on improving the functionality and security of bitcoin. They also follow rough consensus, which just means almost everyone needs to be onboard with any certain bip before implementing it. Its better than democracy where the majority rules the minority. 

2) Full nodes: These are just individuals taking responsibility for their own money and not allowing developers, miners or corporations control their money. This part of bitcoin is also very decentralized.

3) Mining: Now here is where shitcoiners say its centralized. Lets just ignore the mining pool argument coz we all know its BS. The second argument is that only 2-3 companies manufacture asics and asics are somewhat out of reach for plebs. So this just concentrates hashpower in the hands of big mining companies. 

My rebuttal: I think economies of scale are a physical reality and should not be looked down upon. Its what lets people compete, innovate and move the industry forward. We always say that mining is unprofitable for plebs, but thats only where good exchanges exist. In the absence of exchanges, mining is the only way to produce bitcoin and is de-facto profitable. Also the raw materials needed for mining are completely distributed ie. the materials needed for asic manufacturing and electricity and there is no way that one entity could ever have control over these. So in theory, there is never anyone stopping you from building your own asics, just like people build their own wallets. As long as this remains a reality, Id keep calling mining decentralized. And PoW is exactly what makes this possible.

1690,1663698196,False,"I want a mobile app that allows me to have all of the following, integrated into a single interface:

\- A Lightning wallet, that can send &amp; receive sats

\- A Bitcoin OnChain wallet, that allows me to send/receive Bitcoin on chain

\- A fiat wallet, that allows me to send and receive 1 or many of GBP, USD, EUR, make payments in regular POS systems and take money out of an ATM

In an ideal world, I'd be able to instantly move funds between all 3 of these wallets, as well as have a physical card, perhaps a pre-paid visa card, to pay in fiat like we regularly do.

I'm currently travelling and getting killed with conversion fees, card fees, atm fees etc, and I can't help but think that something like this would solve all my problems and stop me paying enough in fees to put my banks' kids through college :)

The closest I've found so far has been my [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) card, but they don't let me send/receive on lightning, they're set up, from a UX perspective, as an exchange - a place to buy and sell crypto - as opposed to a 'daily use' wallet for spending sats/btc/gbp/usd/eur, and when I use the card as a normal daily card outside my 'home country', the fees add up pretty fast.

So - is there anyone out there providing this sort of service? And if not, should I build it?! And if it's not possible, why not?

Because they literally will send me EXACTLY the amount of Bitcoin, with no fees or anything, and they will credit my account in $, for the exact value of the Bitcoin I send them when/if I fund my account.

1776,1663754883,False,"Many of us have heard the notion of people literally NEEDING Bitcoin in their daily lives, however, what do they need it for?  Here are the top 3 common themes we observed when discussing with our community at Purse.

 1. Remittance payments.  They are still very difficult to conduct in many countries. Some countries such as India have BANNED the use of platforms such as Paypal for individuals but still allow certain merchants. This was due to strict anti-money laundering regulations.

Bitcoin allows these people to send money to loved ones or conduct business activities overseas.  A recent survey revealed that 38% of freelancers regularly use cryptocurrency, Bitcoin being one of the most common. Without Bitcoin, many would be limited to domestic markets.

2. Banking  For many around the world opening a bank account is very difficult. More than 1.6 Billion people around the world are currently unbanked. This means no access to savings, checking, insurance.  These people cannot even buy products or services online.

Around 76% of U.S adults shop online. Bitcoin gives the unbanked an opportunity to participate in this craze, with more business's adopting by the day.  For example, you can buy Amazon products with Bitcoin here:  [https://purse.io/shop](https://t.co/RCcY1nydk9)

3.  Gift card liquidation  Many people get payed in Gift cards (eg Amazon) however, many countries have extremely high custom fees for using them, making them worthless in many cases. In India, these fees can get over 50%.One of our earners, Y.G, mentioned that he was asked to pay a 73% customs fee on an Amazon gift card that he won at a hackathon. This made it obsolete and thus found Purse as a method to liquidate into Bitcoin, a currency he could actually use as he doesn't have a bank account.

The reason many use Purse is for an opportunity to earn and shop in this freedom currency that cannot be censored like fiat and many cryptocurrencies we have today. We have a way people can earn Bitcoin and spend Bitcoin. We have indeed created our own circular economy.

We at Purse have a large community of people who have a NEED to use Bitcoin daily. We spoke with some of our most interesting earners in our latest article  One person we interviewed lived off of Bitcoin for almost 2 years. Click below to read!

1780,1663758872,False,"So, I've done the math. Not because it's hard math, but because it's interesting math.

Let's assume that Bitcoin really someday becomes the de facto global currency that everyone uses and that replaced fiat.

Ok, now that we have all jizzed, let's do some calculations with the post-nut clarity.

Currently, the top 1% of the population owns around 50% of total wealth. Numbers vary a bit, but we have to use something.

This 1% therefore has to own 10.5M Bitcoins combined (in reality even a bit less).

At a time where this becomes relevant, world population might be around 10B (but a billion more or less does not really matter).

Thus, to be in the richest 1% in Bitcoin (so 100M people) you have to have at least roughly 0.1BTC. which is less than $2,000 as of today.

Which is pretty interesting. $2000 can put you in the richest 1% of the whole world population, if (and I know, that's a big if) Bitcoin spreads to be a real global currency used by everyone.

Now I bring you a 3-step stress test which once again reveal how effective this material for securing seedphrases and sensitive passwords. This new test was done by a third party that has no association with me nor my product.

&amp;#x200B;

# Intro →

Back when I did that furnace experiment (April), I sent the same plate to [Jameson Lopp](https://www.lopp.net/), an American cypherpunk very well known in the crypto community for his deep focus on privacy and security. He is also known for reviewing crypto metal backups with his trusted methodology and documenting it in his [GitHub page](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/).

Also a fun fact about Lopp is that he lives completely [off the grid](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/technology/how-to-disappear-surveillance-state.html).

Quote:

&gt;""My mission is to use my skills as a technologist to build tools that empower individuals. The most direct way I believe I can achieve that at this time is to make it easier for people to take custody of their bitcoin and manage their private keys.""

Just two weeks ago (August 27) Lopp posted the results of the tests on his [blog page](https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-tests-round-vi/) and I was very excited when I saw that as I have been working on this project since January 2021. I love to see my product recognized by respected people in the community.

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

# His 3-step methodology →

🔥 **Heat:**

He uses a large propane torch that can reach 1093 °C  (2000 °F)  in order to simulate house fire temperatures. Heat is applied for 10 minutes or until device failure is observed. Once the heating is done, he submerges the device in a bucket of water to quickly cool it down.

☣️ **Corrosion:**

He then submerges the device in a bucket with muriatic acid for 12+ hours and them pull them out once the bubbling stops.

https://preview.redd.it/d843c3ska8p91.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc56c9fe6571d36065334de45a0ffc11b051e5fe

🔨 **Crushing:**

And finally, he uses a 20 ton hydraulic press against the device and after that he checks the device's data for readability.

# Stress test &amp; Results →

Testing begins... (All pictures were taken by Lopp)

[Brand new plate](https://preview.redd.it/63fi1scsa8p91.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d072c74b6857d2a9d1d62dca46ad4837365a3cf9)

**Stamping**

He used an alphabetical stamping set and wrote ""HODL"" in every cell.

[Fully stamped plate](https://preview.redd.it/9h8zj83xa8p91.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ded3a817e11f9770a95547ec07cf4573b209e682)

**Heat test**

These colors look pretty crazy but you can see all stamped characters and even the template is still there.

[\(Heat\) No data loss](https://preview.redd.it/varmd8f4b8p91.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301538318cd1723f716c3f777152bec43dcdc5fc)

**Corrosion test**

The acid took away most of the template but it does not have an effect as the integrity of the stamped data doesn't have a correlation with the template.

[\(Corrosion\) No data loss](https://preview.redd.it/ybdo4cr5b8p91.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c8a18ac197599ec20f90b282e1d6963da9e609)

**Crushing test**

Looks like a slight deformation is visible but the 14 GA. (\~2mm) steel is extremely tough.

[\(Crushing\) No data loss](https://preview.redd.it/41662hq6b8p91.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7df69963ebeb8bc29c0b5f3bd53780ebfaccfbde)

&amp;#x200B;

The Plate S is uncontested when it comes to readability compared to my other steel backups, all data is 100% visible and even in the case of extreme stress testing, all characters are still intact. This is the advantage of using character based encoding compared to dot-based, even when the steel is severely damaged the recovery process is very straight forward, all letters/numbers are just there and can be read by the naked eye.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final thoughts →

This plate survived the tests and has shown once again that AISI 304 steel has an excellent  price/quality ratio when it comes to protecting cryptocurrency.

What are your thoughts on Lopp's methodology? What is your preferred way of backing up your seedphrase?

I'm very satisfied with the results. For the next stress test I plan to do some outdoor experiments like leaving a plate on my roof for 1 year or burring it under the dirt. Stay tuned!

The CFTC is coming out with a bill to regulate spot markets, and it is a hyper authoritarian bill.

again there are two massive issues with the bitcoin community. 1) Statist do not care if the State does Statist things 2) The Law is much too complex to convey the ulterior \*intent\* of the United States

&amp;#x200B;

The US is working with numerous major acts to slowly encircle what you would understand as Bill of Rights civil liberties, and engaging in incrementalism towards full capture. 

They \*\*\*are\*\*\* trying to claim that code is a violation of law in and of itself.

If Jack Dorsy's team makes Web 5 software, they under this constellation of laws are found to have violated the Banking Secrecy act, for not collecting KYC for the people using Dorsy's bitcoin only tech.

If Dorsey sends that tech overseas, those non US citizen will still be imprisoned, sued, extradited. 

If anyone builds any software designed to work with Bitcoin, like Bisq, they can be hunted. In fact if the US cements enough of these laws with precedent, they \*will\* eventually look to imprison the developers of Bisq.

That is in many ways, their ultimate goal, to have the legal authority to work out an extradition deal for the countries that the Bisq developers (ideal example) live in.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the reality you chose, when you agreed to a US centric law based system, with licenses, financial institutions, regulatory barriers, trade agreements, tariff, protectionism, mercantilism, immense regulatory moats, you agreed to \*enforcement\*

The US uses bilateral intergovernmental treaties with most other countries to enforce among other major act

\-Dodd-frank (shut down foreign exchanges that do business with US citizen illegally)

\-New CFTC regulation (shut down \*any software, anywhere in the world\* that touches a US citizen\*)

Strike did a similar thing to me some weeks ago when I was just applying for the account: “Sorry, you will not be able to have an account with us”.

And both say “We can’t tell you why, for security reasons”.

Is it because I retired in February?

I have never had issues until now, when I had a large amount in there. 

I have communicated with them via email but have not been given much advice. It has not updated in 4 weeks and balance zero. They assure me when it finally updates [as bitcoin drops continuously and I cannot Daily trade] that my balance will update.

Anyone else having this issue?
Just curious.
Any fixes?

Is there a way I'm unare of to reroute my data to one app?

Idk what to do to speed this up. It's been stuck at 4 weeks and 0 btc but they can allegedly see it on the blockchain. Please help

Edit:update its now at 5 weeks! After batching nonstop! #winning. Thanks for the haters and I love you true enthusiasts, dearly. The one guy pointed me down a butcoin dumb rabbit hole that also could have helped but I don't have my laptop",anyone use the bitcoin app?,0.29

Maybe this has been discussed before.

I was thinking how the complete Blockchain for protection can be stored everywhere but not entirely everywhere.  In silicon valley (TV series) the term data sharding is used and I have read how it's actually used in databases....

Just to clarify on know nodes can work on hashed merkle trees to better manage storage and for checking, instead monitor the block headers.

But who should hold the ""entire"" block chain? Everyone!

Why not instead have sections of the Blockchain (1GB chunks) distributed.  To be on the network you must store a chunk of the Blockchain as well as the most recent (1GB chunk).  People may need to store more than one chunk if more nodes leave the network.  Each chunk stored be stored on at least 3 seperate/different nodes (redundancy).

1929,1663849007,False,"I have used several trading platforms and Bisq being one of them. Here is a brief overview and I would also like to hear your thoughts.

Bisq is a decentralised exchange and is known for peer-to-peer trading with no KYC, you have the option to create your own offer or choose an offer already listed by fellow traders. However, BTC is an initial requirement before using the platform. 

To buy BTC you need the fiat equivalent amount of BTC plus a percentage amount defined by your peer. This extra amount of BTC is locked and used as a deposit to secure the transaction ​via escrow.  

Once you have entered a trade, there is a timeframe of approximately 24 hours for the seller to confirm the payment has been made into your account, after which it could be taken to arbitration, but transactions rarely take this long. As this is a peer-peer system, it is unrealistic to expect traders to confirm straight away, but not impossible. The security deposit is then returned to both you and the seller after your trade is successful.  

The UI is not for the light-hearted and could be quite difficult to understand, so not too inviting on that front. But overall, it is a very community driven platform where trust in each other is a core principle, encouraging solidarity within the community. Of course, there may be bad actors but that is unfortunately, a consequence of society.  

However, the only issues I have run in to are from external influences where my bank would not allow the funds to be transferred until I went in person to confirm my identity in the name of 'fraud prevention', therefore delaying my trade (ironically, further highlighting the issue with centralisation). For internal issues, Bisq have an arbitration and mediation system in place to assist through any trade related problems.

1956,1663869529,False,"The current news from around the globe including Argentina, Pakistan, Haiti, Sri Lanka, Lebanon and across Africa paints a grim picture of global trade and finances. 

The country currencies at the periphery of the dollar global financial system are in retreat.   Capital is fleeing to the center (USD) at all levels of society causing the [Dollar’s relative value to increase](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy).  Many small countries are effectively dollarizing.  Either explicitly like El Salvador or in black market trading such as in VZ and AR.  

In dollar terms commodities and goods that have been over produced will deflate as the world economy slows due to stagflation and malinvestment.  This process, along with government policies restricting production, will ensure that sufficient investments in new production will not be made.  Meanwhile, costs of goods such as food and other essentials will rise due to shortages in production resulting from global government  actions including: pandemic response, sanctions, regulation and etc. 

Rising debt payments due to rising interest rates and reduced export production of slowing economies is triggering the sale of assets to make loan payments and preserve capital.  It is a cause of short to medium term deflation in financial assets and assets sensitive to rising rates.  Trade imbalances, rising US interest rates, debt, inflation and slowing production will collide with 13 trillion (BIS) of foreign debt, trillions in derivatives and foreign held US bonds, stocks and real estate. 

The US dollar is the world reserve currency.  The US central bank (CB), soon faced by a myriad of crises including high unemployment, shrinking GDP, rising energy costs and global food insecurity will abandon its tightening under government pressure.  Interest rates will again be forced lower by CB intervention.  US government spending and CB easing (at 8% inflation the purchasing power is halved every 9 years) will steadily erode the dollar into the next decade.  The value of the dollar for international trade has become uncertain.

As a result, economic conflicts between nations are on the rise.  Sanctions impede the flow of capital between trading partners.  Regulation by governments further restrict international exchange.   The demand by many individuals, groups and governments for an alternative for trade has become a powerful driver for change.

As confidence in the global reserve currency is eroded and the demand for a alternative becomes essential, the transition to Bitcoin as a technology for exchange [will commence](https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-officials-approve-use-of-crypto-for-cross-border-payments-report) between trading partners that are in search of an apolitical, fair and secure settlement alternative.  Bitcoin brings utility with regard to international exchange including speed, final settlement of transactions, apolitical decentralization, no third party risk, nation state level security model and a fixed monetary policy.   These factors make Bitcoin an obvious choice for government investment as the equal opportunity and inclusive international settlement technology.

Advances in Bitcoin engineering and Taproot development are making DeFi at scale using Bitcoin rails possible.  Energy and commodities trading that leverage Bitcoin based DeFi contracts will emerge.  Gold will play its role as a store of value and enhance Bitcoin utility as the record keeper in a secure and trusted trade settlement layer.   Use of Bitcoin’s DeFi network as a trading layer will gradually transform the monetary energy of the underlying commodities, currencies and other assets within the Bitcoin trading ecosystem.   Once trade volumes and the types of trade between trading partners can be transparently recorded and known then the relative trade weighting of local currency value can be calculated.   The design of Bitcoin is fair and transparent.  All participants benefit in proportion.  No single participant, government or group has more control than another.

The transition will be complete.   Bitcoin and its financial layers will have subsumed the international trade system.  A new age of fair trade between politically and economically diverse forms of government and people can begin.",Bitcoin and the Transition of the Global Trade System,0.57

The economy and the stock market are cyclical, but the Bitcoin revolution is here to stay. The key is to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin. And Bitcoin's fundamentals haven't changed since its inception, so there's no reason to panic.

I gave her some info specifically on Bitcoin's stats from Saylor and the most recent Bitcoin Mining Council report and while she found some problems within them, she was genuinely intrigued and impressed.  
2nd Professor we had more of a heated intense debate in front of his class (we like each other so it was fine).

But, most people are dumb. They will see a fast/cheaper money-transfer solution that is being offered by a ‘trusted’ source, so they will all jump on it. And if/when fiat fails, what better way to scare people into using your shiny new currency that is fully-controlled and monitored at all times.

Solutions like bitcoin take control away from government and give that control back to the people, which cannot be allowed (according to those in power). So, these scary solutions will be pushed out, taxed, and prohibited et al. so that people will have no reasonable choice but to use the ‘official’ currencies, whatever form that ends up being.

Every, single time money exchanges hands, every purchase, will be monitored, tracked, taxed and fully-controlled. They will know how much you have, where it came from and where it’s going -at all times. They will decide if you are allowed to make certain purchases or transfers, based on your age, location, nationality, tax debt, child support debt, criminal history etc.; whatever they see fit.

Eventually, even your political views and online posts may be weighed as a matter of national security, allowing justification of more control. Something like this will need to be in place before a universal income system is established, which seems likely to happen, eventually.

2267,1664114838,False,"This post is for all you Crypto holders out there. Whether you are panicking during this bear market (09-2022), or you are Hodling like a champ. It matters not. This message is for you all.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin was created in the ashes of the last financial crisis that started in 2007, but really bit everyone toward the end of 2008. The first block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined  on 03/01/2009. The creator of Bitcoin made it clear in that first block what his intentions were for Bitcoin. I will let you explore the rabbit hole of what the creator embedded into that first block for yourselves online.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, Bitcoin has flown under the radar of those that would be ultimately threatened by it, that is if it were to survive so long. And alas it did, and those entities definitely feel threatened now.

&amp;#x200B;

As the Fiat Monetary System buckles under its own contradictions, the elite (if you permit me to call them this, they certainly would consider themselves as such) scramble to roll out a successor to the Fiat Monetary System and it is no surprise that they model their ideas on those that Bitcoin pioneered. They know that the ultimate challenger to their ideas of resetting their “Exorbitant Privilege” to some new and shiny system, is Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

What they want to create would be the Mr Hyde, as compared to the Dr Jekyll of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to warn you one and all.

The bear market in crypto is not new, nor is this one over yet.

As the rest of the hyper-financialised world, smouldering but likely to really catch fire soon, the sentiment around Bitcoin will also sour. Projects on the fringes of the crypto world will crumble, people’s “moon bags” will implode.

&amp;#x200B;

What the elite will hope for is: that those that have lost in the crypto world to complain and beg for regulations in a misguided hope of redeeming some of their personal losses.

&amp;#x200B;

I beg of you to refrain.

Do not complain to the authorities about your losses.

Losses are the normal course of investing and should be taken as strong lessons in research and due diligence.

&amp;#x200B;

If you believe in crypto, then you believe in self sovereign money, a monetary system outside the control of any centralised authority - if you truly believe this, then do not hypocritically beg for some central authority to come and save you from investments gone bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto bear markets are bad, but they are caused by events outside the decentralised systems that run them (on the whole). Unlike commodities, equities and forex markets that are rigged to work against you, the small investor, just trying to get a leg up in this rigged world, Bitcoin is completely free from direct manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are confronted with 2 casinos, one is known to be rigged to favour the house and the elite, while the other is mathematically proven to be fair. Which to enter? But more importantly how do you feel about your losses?

1. Self custody bitcoin without being online aka use as a cold wallet
2. Approve sell/move out transactions without going online.

Now, I see many may be interested only in point 1, where people going to hodl for few years/decade before they sell. They still buy a hardware wallet for this purpose alone. Why not we have a replacement solution for this?

I am thinking of something like a bank outlet, Thompson/prometric exam center, where I can book a time slot of 30 mins. This will be a secured environment with no one around, no cameras. There will be a kiosk which is not connected to the internet. I can go, generate my seed and come back home. Pay a price of $10. The app associated will generate public addresses and I can move my stash anytime and everytime. 

 Is something like this already there? What drawbacks can this have? I have given a few below:

1. Some user may book it and install a spy camera to get other's seeds (Solution: Security checks, like phones and cameras are not allowed in prometric today, when we go to write an exam).

2. People coming out may get a $5 wrench attack. (Solution: we don't move out our stack there. We only generate seed. We can move it later on when we are back home)

3. Not worth the risk for $70 savings (compared to ledger nano s+). If we are going long, this 70 bucks will not hurt much. - true, this can't be refuted.  But if we are going for mass adoption, not all can have a ledger device. So this may not be correct now, but may be useful in future.

*Hi guys, hope you are having a great sunday. I'm Venezuelan living here, been posting this since 2018 (I suppose that makes me a crypto veteran hahaha)*

*As always I like to post these stats. I know LocalBitcoin is not widely used anymore, but it has an API and you can see the traded amout each week.*

*Years ago over 2k BTC were were traded in ONE week here in Venezuela, now it is around 35 BTC weekly. Binance took most of the volume, same with AirTM, Reserve and others, sadly their stats aren't public so we don't know the traded amount (not only for BTC).*

*Binance even has P2P, so  you can go Bolivares (Bs. national currency) to crypto back and forth.*

*Yes, monthly minimum wage is 130 Bolivares (* [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-minimum-wage-risen-18-115603945.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-minimum-wage-risen-18-115603945.html)  *it says 126 Bs. but in the end it was set to 130 Bs. and at the time was 30 USD).*

*Right now exchange rate is around 1 USD = 8 Bs. so, around 16 USD monthly.*

*Average wage is around 80-120 USD. You need much more than that monthly to live.*

*One BTC is around 160,000 Bs.*

*People use crypto to send remittances to their relatives, savings (staying away from Bolivares), to purchase things (some stores accept crypto directly) and MINERS, a lot of miners here (even when in theory is legal, it's risky) even after the merge GPU mining is still profitable here because electricity is free!*

*Crypto has helped a lot here in the country!*

Japan is now selling US treasuries to prop up the Yen and China will start doing the same as the Yuan comes under pressure, which it already is. China and Japan are by far the largest holders of US treasuries in the world therefore they have the ability to add massive selling pressure to the US bond market causing US treasuries to fall faster which should lead to the US dollar rally losing momentum (no one wants to hold dollars if the Chinese government is selling their $1 trillion dollar stock pile of US treasuries).

As the dollar rally loses momentum the world will be looking for an exit out of the dollar and into any other safe haven they can find. With bitcoin being down 70% from its highs and with a market cap 1/20th that of gold it looks extremely attractive if it is infact digital gold. So expect a meaningful percentage of safe-haven-seeking capital to make its way into bitcoin.

Its at this point bitcoin catches its first safe haven bid during a global currency crisis ever. This is when the bitcoin price shocks the world to the upside.

My answer: There is, and that's why we fight every day for the Bitcoin revolution to succeed. We have no guarantees other than those given by the Bitcoin protocol.

But the guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol are incredible:

1. There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
2. 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
3. An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
4. A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
5. A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
6. Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
7. A permanently available network (Uptime &gt; 99.985% since Bitcoin creation)
8. A never hacked network
9. The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable
10. The Bitcoin code is open source

If you follow me, you can see why we Bitcoiners are so excited about the Bitcoin revolution. The Bitcoin system is designed to give us hard money that cannot be censored by the powerful in the current system.

Bitcoin is a unit of wealth independent of the control of governments and central bankers. And this is where Bitcoin's potential for the future is incredible. That is why we cannot afford not to try to make the Bitcoin revolution a success.

In contrast, the current monetary and financial system is flawed by design. It is not fixable. It gives you a guarantee: that of a programmed collapse sooner or later. You can be sure that the value of fiat currencies will continue to fall over time.

Every time central banks raise interest rates it kills supply production of goods first. For example in real estate they stop building new homes and then later the price drops. The production of new supply gets cut first which just esclates the problems. 

Another case study is when QT takes place it cost the government more due to lack of efficency. Bob loses his job and stops buying $100/week in food, now he goes to the food bank and get $200/week in food and throws half of it away because they give him a bunch of crap his family doesn't like. The spending doubles due to the inefficent market, but the government prints money and gives to the food bank thanks to biden's food insecurity act.

The question is, what happens if in the future, bitcoin price goes very high and we end up with money enough for, let’s say, buy a house.

Of course we won’t be able to justify that amount of money. Even if we don’t sell our bitcoin for fiat and the house seller accepts bitcoin, you’ll end up being owner of a house that “you can’t afford” according to your declared income.

This got me thinking, will in the future (let’s say 10 years) our NON-KYC bitcoin only be usable for groceries, gas and small cash purchases? If not, how could we in the middle of the way to the moon, suddenly declare “oh I forgot, I had this bitcoin for a few years”.

Economy is a system for producing and exchanging resources. Money is a specific type of resource that has features like durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, and acceptability. In 2008, a person or group under the identity Satoshi Nakamoto, allegedly invented a payment system that produces and exchanges money in the form of electronic coins, generally known as bitcoins. Here we will use Nakamoto’s own definition of coins to show that they did not invent the said system, but a social game. In that game, cryptographically signed numeric attributions are recorded into a distributed database called “blockchain”. This simulates the recording of quantity such as is done in the production or exchange of resources. Given that Nakamoto’s invention neither produces nor exchanges resources, this makes it a Monopoly-style game, and not something related to economy and money.

If it's just a fake Screen it is not in the spirit of bitcoin and setting up real lighting wallets for them seems excessive since they won't spend from there at their local shops anyway.

I'm incredibly proud to finally publish an article I've been working on for a while titled ""[Bitcoin: Freedom Money](https://tmccarthy94.medium.com/bitcoin-freedom-money-55e7404717cf)"".

It discusses how Bitcoin embodies American values and how many of its inherent protocol properties symbolize important amendments on freedom found in the U.S. Constitution.

I fully believe Bitcoin is global and want BTC to succeed at a global scale. However, I live in DC and I spend time educating congressional staffers, Treasury, and any official I can speak with about the importance of Bitcoin. So the purpose of this article is to have a more U.S. centric framework, but in reality, the discussions of freedom can be incorporated into any nation that supports freedom and personal liberties.

Huge thanks to everyone in the Bitcoin community who I've learned from over the past couple of years. You all are the reason why I've become so educated on this topic and why I'm able to defend Bitcoin in a multitude of debates I'm having at events in DC.

Now it's my turn to continue educating efforts and I hope you find this article useful. Feel free to connect with me on twitter: @ tmccarthyv94

2589,1664319335,False,"His life would be unbelievably busy. Everyone would know who he is. He'd be the most popular person on the planet and Elon Musk would look like he's nothing in comparison. Regardless of what you think of cryptocurrency, there is no one else alive right now who has been as impactful as Satoshi Nakamoto. Even Buttcoiners would be scrambling to trade more of their fiat to buy bitcoins as Satoshi types even one word somewhere identifying as Nakamoto. There are literally millions of bots that are watching Nakamato's wallet/forum posts like a hawk. Coin exchanges would instantly raise the price to something ridiculous like $250,000 if any of Nakamoto's activity reactivated. If there are only 8,500,000 bitcoins in active circulation, that's only $2.125T in total market cap. 

Anyways, Satoshi Nakamoto is a walking Fort Knox. He could instantly change a lot of people's lives for better or worse. As for his own life, if I was him, I would be very fearful for my safety. I'd expect that at this point, you'd be recruited by your own government. I wonder if the government does know of his identity, what they would have done if they met up with him soon after he created Bitcoin. I assume that Satoshi would have gotten a spec ops level kidnapping at this point, back then I don't know. He has at minimum multiple hundreds of billions of dollars in stock, if the right circumstances were met which top levels of governments can definitely force to make happen if they have your body at their control. Many governments don't like that Bitcoin is a currency that they don't own either so you're basically fucked, some random government has to come find you and capture you; if anything, if they sold off all of Satoshi's bitcoin, they'd be able to disrupt a lot of people's lives.

He may be hodling onto the coins but he probably had a few other wallets that he mined Bitcoin on that he sells off slowly. He could easily be a billionaire right now with just 15,000 coins mined early on if he kept buying low and selling high. He at least has multiple hundreds of millions I would assume. The fact that Nick Szabo's networth is reported to be $2,000,000 to me doesn't say much because Satoshi wouldn't have to hold his money in a bank like us, it'd be hidden and protected by a government especially since it ensures they gain a percentage of money as a result of their partnership in securing bitcoin with Nakamoto. It's in their best interest to be partnered with the owner of a currency, if not just kidnapping Satoshi and torturing him for information to gain ownership over Satoshi's identity, who is actually just a spy that's paid to shill his government all day (or else he'll get Funkytown'd up). At this level of government, there are no morals and everyone's a potential pawn including the government themselves so why would Satoshi get away with being himself so easily? He's going to need protection from a government, so he has no choice but to surrender himself to someone so it might as well be your own government to feel safe from getting tortured for who knows how long? Never know how angry someone is or why. People are looking for a good scapegoat to throw their evil on -- ""The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists"". Him staying so quiet has probably saved him a lot of trouble. People in this world will take you to funky town so much harder than we could imagine just for the fun of it. I digress but now that I think about it, whenever the government takes certain actions, they know what's going to happen in the trade off. Maybe one of ours gets tortured to death like another government threatened. What is the percentage of people who went missing from our militaries that have their status marked as ""Enemy government policy states they will torture them for as long as possible 24/7 until x and y is done.""

My questions come from a number of different perspectives, one of which is related to fees in a post reward world. People seem to think that we need the vast number of miners as the network grows, but as I mentioned at the beginning it seems like the number of miners is not important to the basic function.

2629,1664341205,False,"Hey all, just sparking a discussion here.

For those not aware, *The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule requires businesses to collect and share the personal data of participants in a transaction*.

As a crypto company's customer (for custodial services), **you** have to **share** the **personal data of sender/recipient** **whenever you deposit/withdraw** funds from/to outside the company.

It's a stupid rule for crypto, and can be easily circumvented by **withdrawing to your own wallet** and then do wtf you want with it.

But I'm wondering, in cases like *Strike* and *Lastbit/Striga*, where you have LN-enabled wallets (either in fiat or btc), and can be used for LN payments, (how) can this be applied?

I mean, you can't ask for a person to input personal information of every payment they make! Not to mention, every micropayment.

But what I'm also wondering, how much does this stifle innovation? Are crypto service companies blocked right now by this? How does Strike allow to send your dollars through LN instantly and for free, to **any** LN invoice, when the travel rule is mandatory?",(how) Can a BTC/LN company apply the travel rule?,0.71

However, I am kinda having second thoughts about it becoming the global monetary standard or the unit of account. 

My main concern is that if everything would be denominated in Bitcoin then ,considering that Bitcoin is deflationary, people would tend to not spend their Bitcoin because they know they can buy more stuff with it the more they wait. This will be counter productive to economical growth and technological innovation because it will mean people will take less risks like starting a business/project or investing it in some kind of endeavour. The fiat standard encourages people to spend as soon as possible (which is not the best because most will spend it on unuseful things) but the ""positive"" to this is that it forces some of the people to also take chances and risks trying something entrepreneurial. 

The easy access of capital and dropping purchasing value of fiat makes a lot of people try to start business etc and obviously while most of them will fail the few that succeed are very good because the competition is so fierce. It basically makes the innovation process more ruthless and hence the outcome more optimal.

Obviously, a fiat standard sucks in so many other areas that I don't need to state here so it's not a good solution either but maybe some kind of also decentralised money with a preprogrammed dynamic inflation in it or something like that to keep the people ""on their asses"" to innovate ?",Would operating on a Bitcoin standard hurt the pace of innovation ?,0.79

2759,1664408370,False,"On the 3rd of January 2009, The Times published a front page article with the heading ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"". 

These words were stamped in the Genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain.

While Nakamoto never clearly stated the meaning of the message, many have interpreted it as a reference to why Nakamoto developed Bitcoin: to cut out the banks and middlemen that he saw as corrupt and unreliable, electing to create a more people-driven currency.

It [transpired](https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/bank-of-england-reveals-secret-61-6bn-loans-to-rbs-and-hbos/a369533) the Bank of England provided emergency funding of **£61.6bn** to crisis hit banks at the height of the financial crisis. 

On Tuesday night, the yield on any new long-term government borrowing had risen to 5% – the highest level since the global financial crisis of 2008. The rapid upward move in gilt yields had implications for mortgage rates, overdrafts, company loans and pension funds.

[As a result, the Bank has responded with a temporary and targeted round of quantitative easing (QE) – the bond buying programme that it originally launched in early 2009.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/28/banks-intervention-may-not-mark-the-end-of-market-mayhem)

It plans initially to spend **£65bn** – £5bn a day – buying UK bonds until mid October. 

The Bank has not paid for the bonds in cash, it has created the money with a guarantee from the Treasury, which means that every pound is covered by the taxpayer.

It's been pointed out that this money printing has predominantly been used to [bail out the pension funds of the Boomers (58 - 76).](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/pension-funds-would-collapsed-today-25131648)

It's worth while pointing out everything that's happening in the UK is largely without a mandate from the British people. A group of politicians ousted the Prime Minister with one of the largest electoral mandates in history (13,966,454 votes).

It became clear that many had an agenda to further their own career. The replacement PM Liz Truss was voted in by just 81,326 members of the Conservative party. Now she's taking the country down her own completely new experimental financial path which is never appeared in any conservative party manifesto... crashing the gilt market and pound as she goes.

Things got so bad that another unelected, unaccountable party... the Central Bank of England.. undemocratically prints £60+ billion out of thin air to predominantly bail out boomers (of which there are many among them)... adding to the taxpayer tab to be paid off by subsequent generations going through their own cost of living crisis.

In short... thank fuck for Satoshi and Crypto. It may not be perfect but at least today there are freely open, transparent, democratic and decentralised alternative financial systems we can participate in should we wish. That's fair and true democracy. 

**TDLR**

In 2022 the Bank Of England has just repeated a similar styled money printing bailout that inspired the movement behind the worlds first crypto Bitcoin in 2008/9. Let's hope the actions of today's undemocratic financial and political elite, inspire a whole new generation to keep driving the decentralised financial revolution forward in the same way.","The Bank Of England just committed Billions of Q.E. to Bail out Boomer pensions, in a similar historic moment that inspired Satoshi and the Bitcoin movement.",0.97

Well, in reality, bitcoin has value since it's inception.

He did that because he saw value in it.

Some other persons saw enough value in Bitcoin as to download the code and running a miner spending time and energy in the process. You don't do this if you don't see value in what you get.

Jared here from a bitcoin + lightning only company, Mash, appreciate it is a bit of self self-promotion, but I wanted to share the following with you all, to get any and all feedback – the good, the bad, the ugly if you can spare the scarce time!

We recently launched a Wordpress Plugin with one-click-donations aka Boosts and an integrated lightning wallet (no downloads for users required). This way users can easily support creators and give feedback on what they love most (with sats!). We wanted to make the experience as simple and easy to use as possible and feedback is incredibly helpful! For non-Wordpress sites, we have guides for how to add things (a few pieces of copy/paste code).

Relevant links are here to check it out.

* **Boosts**: [https://www.getmash.com/boosts](https://www.getmash.com/boosts)
* **Wordpress** **Plugin** – [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mash-monetize-earn-and-grow-your-experiences-w-bitcoin-lightning/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mash-monetize-earn-and-grow-your-experiences-w-bitcoin-lightning/)
* **Guide**: [https://guides.getmash.com/boosts-overview](https://guides.getmash.com/boosts-overview)
* **Get Started**: [https://wallet.getmash.com/earn](https://wallet.getmash.com/earn)

Really appreciate the scarce time, which is the only thing scarcer than Bitcoin.

Thank you!

It is for this reason specifically, that we believe it would be in your best interests for you all to [implement a feature that Michael Saylor Previously suggested - an ""Orange Check Mark.""](https://podclips.com/c/mUfG3B?ss=r&amp;ss2=bitcoin&amp;d=2022-05-07)                

Working for a software company myself, I am avidly aware that you have your own development and features roadmap that your development team is occupied with for the remainder of the 2022 year. We are hoping that this could be a feature that is scheduled for implementation in Q1 or Q2 of 2023.                       

We believe that there is a common consensus that many bitcoiners are willing to pay a certain amount of satoshis to obtain an Orange Check Mark. Having spent a long time meditating on how to get rid of spam-bots on social media myself, we all know this is not the be-all-end-all solution, but when we check the comments section of any [tweet made by Jack](https://i.imgur.com/KMPXZBX.png) we simply see spam from people mentioning obscure alt-coins.              

Now we should outline the features and purposes of the Orange Check mark. Proposed features of an Orange Check Mark:              
* Users with Orange Check Mark Have the option to restrict communication exclusively to other users with an Orange Check mark every time they tweet or retweet something on Twitter.               
* User Default: Once a user enables the Orange Check Mark, it is on by default, and can be enabled or disabled when a user brings up their tweet window. [proposed example](https://i.imgur.com/5u3H195.png).                       
* Easy Opt-in and Opt-out. A user simply deposits 10,000 satoshis (or a changing variable amount, updated yearly, depending on bitcoin volatility) to obtain their Orange Check Mark, and can withdraw the satoshis they deposited to opt-out.                
* Not Fully Restrictive: If Bob has an Orange Check Mark and Bob follows Alice, but Alice does not have an Orange Check Mark, Alice may interact with Bob's Orange Check Mark restricted Tweets as well.                 
* Not Fully Restrictive 2: If Bob does not have an Orange Check Mark, and if Dave has an Orange Check Mark and neither Bob nor Dave know each other, Bob may also only restrict his tweets to Orange Check Mark users only, and Dave may respond to his tweets.                

Benefits outlined by using an Orange Check Mark:                
* As redundant as it may sound, any user who has an Orange Check Mark visibly displays an Orange Check Mark on their Twitter profile where there would ordinarily be a Blue Check Mark for verified people of interest and influencers.                
* All of the Benefits outlined in the proposed features above.

The governments preaching ""green energy"" is not helping with the general prices of things, since our technology is not efficient enough yet to have most of our energy from green energy. Everything is just coming together like multiple trains on their way to crash into each other.

&amp;#x200B;

It is possible that BTC could go to 10k, but that is highly unlikely in many charts. But if a major world event happens, e.g. a nuclear bomb gets dropped, we might be another 50% down. This will only be a Black Swan event though. 

The other option is that BTC will have reached it's bottom here and it will begin it's slow and steady descend up. 

Right now is anyway the best buying opportunity for a long time even if BTC will crash, you just got to have some cash set aside.

Touching back on Germany, they have been A boiling pot for a while now. Transferring from Fossil Fuels and Nuclear energy to Windmills and Solar. This may seem like rainbows and sunshine. I have a few friends who live there and I asked them to share their monthly energy bills with me. They usually payed 150 ish Euros a month. Now they are paying 600 Euros a month. In a 2 Bedroom APARTMENT. THEIR ENERGY PROVIDER ASKED THEM IF THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SWITCH TO ONLY 80% GREEN ENERY, FOR ONLY 800 EUROS A MONTH. 

The average salary is 50k a year in Germany. 50/12 is around 4k a month. 600 goes to energy alone. Factors in 30-45% taxed, there is nothing left to live on if you have a family or whatnot. You don't even have enough money to invest in BTC, even though right now is the best opportunity in a lifetime, for a long time.

I would like to say that Nuclear reactors actually produce LESS C02 per km² than windmills. Go look it up if you don't believe me. France s building more of them and their energy prices are much better, 1/3rd down by average. I would also like to point out that Windmills destroy habitats and wildlife, even when in the Ocean. Don't get me started on solar panels.

Satoshi chimed on page 2:

""A rational market price for something that is expected to increase in value will already reflect the present value of the expected future increases.  In your head, you do a probability estimate balancing the odds that it keeps increasing.

In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks).  The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows down.  If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more.  At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.

In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.

At the moment, generation effort is rapidly increasing, suggesting people are estimating the present value to be higher than the current cost of production.""",Before Bitcoin had a price...,0.8

3027,1664564044,False,"Seriously!  Let's look at the alternatives:

Crypto not named Bitcoin (shitcoins):  Too centralized/captured, or they're a less used/ill conceived version of Bitcoin itself but worse, or they track the $ which is basically fiat.  

Shares of publicly traded companies (stocks):  The management team controls the issuance and buybacks, the prices go up when the central bank lowers rates, and down when the central bank increases rates.  What if the management teams mismanages it or commits fraud.  Also they can be taxed by government and regulated to hell and back.  

Corporate Bonds:  Same issues with management team as with stocks.  Also controllable by the central bank as they will go up when interest rates decrease and vice versa.  No guarantee they will pay higher interest than inflation, and if the corporation goes bankrupt you lose.  And if they are TBTF and go bankrupt, you still lose (see automaker bailouts of 2008).  

Government Bonds:  These are by far the most controlled investment by the government and it's central bank.  Forget it, I'm not a pension fund.  And you'll never beat inflation with these.  

Junk Bonds:  Forget it.  I'm not Michael Milken, and I've got no idea which of these are a good deal and which aren't.  Not willing to take the risk of default.  And besides, these are central bank controllable as well.  

Rental Real Estate:  This is the best productive investment right now IMO, but it's got it's problems.  Eviction moratorium.  Also, just highly overpriced right now and still pretty risky.  St. Paul, Minnesota just enacted rent control.  Orange County, Florida has put rent control on the ballot even though it's illegal in the state.  Even red states have knuckleheads pushing for rent control/stabilization.  Also, you have to deal with tenants not paying rent, maintain/repair, etc.  What if your condo gets wiped out by a Hurricane and you didn't have sufficient insurance.  

Annuities:  You'll get killed by inflation.  Forget it. 

Fiat currency:  Get lost. 

Gold/silver/other precious metals(physical):  Best non-productive asset available not named Bitcoin.  But government/banks can keep the prices suppressed using futures contracts and ETFs.  Also they aren't very fungible and it's hard to independently verify purity and authenticity.  They can be stolen/lost.  You have to pay a cap gain tax when/if you sell, even if price only went up due to inflation.  You can drop your gold bars and damage the assay card (actually happened to me).  Also, metals are mined from the ground, therefore the supply and potential supply is never limited, so a high price will bring more supply to the market.  Easily traceable by government at point of sale/purchase.  

Precious metal ETFs/Futures:  Forget it.  This is playing the government/banks' paper games.  When metals become unattainable and/or unaffordable and spike in price, they will do to you what the LME did to the Nickel market.  That is, cover the big boys at your expense.  No thanks.  

Meme stocks like GME, AMC and BBBY:  Nope.  That's playing poker.  May as well take it to the casino.  

Farmland:  Government can tax it all they want.  Government can tell you ""this is your wheat quota, you're not allowed to produce more wheat than this"", and if you try to grow the wheat to feed your livestock...well, you're affecting the wheat market (which is interstate commerce) by *not buying wheat!*  (This actually happened)  Totally captured by government.  Also, I've never been a farmer, would have to learn.  And it's hard work.  And risky to boot.  No thanks.  

Oil or nat gas futures:  You have to play the paper games to own these.  So it's got the same problem with precious metal futures in that when/if you should ever really win big, the exchange will shut you down and protect the big boys, like the LME and Nickel market.  Also, these have carrying costs of holding.  As far as non-productive assets go, these are some of the toughest to hold onto.  

So, there's probably other investments out there, but this covers most of the major ones.  It's almost kind of like, Bitcoin is the default choice.

You might say, ""Well that's why we have the Lightning Network, duh.""  Ok, but that still means each of these people has to onramp and offramp to/from the LN.

3073,1664578655,False,"Winter is approaching, meaning people are talking about this again.

This idea has been floating around the Internet for a while, so I'd like to gather some data from people because I make a decision regarding it for myself.

The core idea is pretty simple: most people are already paying a good amount of money for a box that gets hot to keep them warm in the winter, so it seems like it would be a smart idea for that box to also give you some Bitcoin which could be used to offset its electricity cost.

Here are my calculations, but I would be interested in hearing from the personal experiences of anyone who has tried doing this themselves and what the results were.

I've recently moved into my first flat for college and it doesn't have centralised heating. Instead, the landlord has provided individual electric space heaters for every room. The space heaters draw about 1 kW of power when turned on, so if they are turned on for six hours a day in two rooms, that would use up a total of 12 kWh of electricity which would cost me 1.20 USD at [roughly 0.10 USD per kilowatt hour](https://www.pacificpower.net/content/dam/pcorp/documents/en/pacificpower/rates-regulation/oregon/tariffs/Oregon_Price_Summary.pdf). That means that I would be paying 36 USD per 30-day month to heat the flat.

On the other hand, I could buy a used Antminer T15 off Amazon for around 400 USD. The NiceHash profitability calculator [tells me](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator/bitmain-antminer-t15) this would end up costing me 1.80 USD per day, but that assumes I leave it on 24/7. If I only turn it on for six hours, or a quarter of the day, it seems to follow that this would only cost me 0.45 USD per day, or 13.50 USD per month, with net savings of 22.50 USD per month. Presumably, the ASIC will also not lose value that fast and I can resell it to recoup some of its purchase cost.

A second option is an Antminer S19J Pro for 3,000 USD which would *earn* me [0.95 USD per day](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator/bitmain-antminer-s19j-pro-(100th)). That means I *earn* 28.50 USD per month representing a ""savings"" of 64.50 USD over using the space heater. Obviously, since it now is profitable to keep it running 24/7, I would, even when it's not winter and not cold, so I would earn a profit year-round. This would earn 346.75 USD per year. The biggest threat with this plan is that of depreciation: if the value of the miner depreciates faster than that, then it might not be as good of an idea as it initially appears.

I would also expect the mining difficulty to go up over time, meaning the amount returned in Bitcoin would be correspondingly less over time.

Would an ASIC be as effective of a heater as an actual space heater?

3098,1664589744,False," There is a glaring lack of bitcoin and blockchain literature in my opinion. The bear market seems a great time to devour any books on blockchain and get some insight from previous cycles. I read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous and here is my book review.

The book is about 300 pages long and the first 165 pages tell the history of money. Bitcoin is barely mentioned at all in this portion of the book. The author starts with Rai Stones on Yap Islands, then metal money such as brass, Roman money, money backed by gold, post gold standard money, and finally brings up the alternative of decentralized digital money. Its all told through the lens of Austrian Economics which advocates individualism. The main tenant of this school in relation to money is that economic incentives will drive individuals to behave rationally to foster economic prosperity. If hard money such as gold is available, people will have a longer time horizon and thus value the future more than the present and make choices like save or build wealth through innovation. The author argues that easy money , or money that can be printed out of thin air, causes society to mortgage the future in favor of short term satisfaction because their wealth will decrease in the future due to currency debasement.

He definitely makes some decent points about hard money (broadly gesture at everything happening right now). However, he takes some big liberties in my opinion. Stating that music and art in the 1800s was better than contemporary art because they had hard money? It was pretty clear he hated Keynesian Economics on a personal level. I'm not a economist or anything, but I felt the tone really subtracted from his credibility.

Then it was on the bitcoin in the final chapters. His explanation wasn’t too technical in nature. He briefly explained the basics such as proof of work, blockchain tech, and hard capped limit. He compares it to gold in the desirable qualities such as durability, portability, acceptability, limited supply, divisibility and uniformity.  The author concludes BTC is digital gold and in many ways superior to gold. Some quotes that really stood out to me: “Bitcoin is the cheapest way to buy the future, because Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased matter how much it's value rises.” He then focuses on BTC potential as a universal sound money making a case that the Banks and countries that adopt early will have a huge advantage. “But perhaps the real case for banks owning Bitcoin is as insurance against the scenario of it succeeding.” Saifedean Ammous also mentions some of the limitations of BTC like TPS and admits that certain types of transactions are not likely to be practical.

All in all I really enjoyed the book. It was an easy read compared to some of the other crypto books that use too much technical jargon. It is a good gateway to the crypto newcomer who wants to get the sense of why the community thinks it so revolutionary. I do also agree with the sentiment that governments cannot resist the lure of printing money to pursue frivolous projects and short term success in a bid to get re elected. Take the money out of the governments hands, they cant be trusted. I give it 19 out of 21 Satoshis.

3120,1664613446,False,"**Forenote:** I'm going to be choosing some cherry-picked data that fits a near-perfect timeline: a little bit over 4 years ago today.               

https://i.imgur.com/He6KEVC.png - The S&amp;P 500 September 7th, 2018 - $2871.68. **Modern day: $3585.62**

Back then, mention of a recession was passive in a sense like, ""Oh, well, we usually have a recession once every decade. We're almost overdue for one now.""            

18 months later, covid hits America and we start printing money (that largely goes to bankers and benefits mega-corporations).              

The M2 money supply: https://i.imgur.com/M8L9jcG.png                     

Inflation: This is hard to actually quantify because the CPI report is based on the average price of an ever-changing basket of cherry-picked goods, that conveniently disregards gas and oil. Let's humor the last CPI report released at the FOMC and say that it is 8.3%. Others say it is as much as 20%. Let's use both spectrums for a thought experiment.              

If we go with the [8.3% figure of $3585.62](https://i.imgur.com/wYBZv3k.png), this means The S&amp;P 500 is actually valued at an actual value of **$3,288.02** in ""2018 dollars"".             

However, if we go with the [20% figure](https://i.imgur.com/e5aro41.png) that would mean the value of the S&amp;P 500 would be valued at **$2868.50** in ""2018 dollars"".           

Now let's apply the same logic to Bitcoin:              

Bitcoin is at $19,323.60 USD. That is nearly 3x the price that it was 4 years ago.              

Accounting for [8.3% inflation](https://i.imgur.com/NnJBpLw.png), bitcoin would be worth **$17,719.75** in ""2018 dollars.""              

And the [20% figure?](https://i.imgur.com/lHSjuFg.png), that would put Bitcoin at **$15,458.88.**               

Just some food for thought. If bitcoin goes lower, I'll definitely buy more. For the record, this is cherry-picked data.

3175,1664640262,False," Hello -

I'm new to Bitcoin Investing, and after doing some research below is what I think so far about crypto and bitcoin. I'd like to hear your comments, and hopefully I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing you have to do with Bitcoin and other crypto's, is to separate them from the story of the Blockchain. 

Rather like separating the story of the Internet away from the story of computers. Computers were not invented for the Internet, that came later. The Internet is a by-product of the computer in the same way that Bitcoin is a by-product of the Blockchain. The Blockchain may be an amazing invention but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is.

There are many stories of the US Government experimenting with digital currencies. Long before Bitcoin, there are news reports of the US government talking about one day turning to digital currencies (CBCD). It's going to happen one day, but will it be like Bitcoin?

**Does Bitcoin work as a currency?**

I think that's it's clear that it doesn't work as a currency. It's too volatile, one day it's 20,000 dollars and the next it's 21,000 dollars. Some retailers will choose to accept Bitcoin whilst it's going up, but will quickly drop its use when it starts to go down. If it was made their only choice, then the volatility that makes it interesting to investors goes away. They would never store their money in Bitcoin as would be seen as too risky. Would you put all your cash flow money from your business into Bitcoin? I think it would be NO. You could wake up in the morning and have twice as much but you could also find yourself without enough money to buy any goods. You would at the least not know where you stood from day to day. 

**Is Bitcoin secure?**

I don't know if there is a backdoor into the Blockchain for Bitcoin. I suspect that there is, but I don't know.

Assuming there isn't a backdoor and the Feds can't look into people's finances. If you bought a car from a dealer using Bitcoin, would your transaction stay private? the answer is NO. The dealer would have to pass on the information about the buyer to the authorities. If you bought a table from Ikea, they would also need your information. If you paid for the table by cheque or credit card they would have your info, so why not Bitcoin. Only cash avoids this. Bitcoin is great on the Black market. If you want to launder money or get rid of your stolen items, it works, and both parties can stay private. But not much use in the real world.

**There are only so many Bitcoins?**

If they can make ever smaller denominations of Bitcoin (satoshis), then you can't use the argument that Bitcoin is limited. There are as many Bitcoin parts as there are specs in the Universe if they choose it to be so. 

**Conclusion.**

Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of collecting baseball cards. Its value is in making other people think it has value. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't invest in Bitcoin. A lot of people made money in Holland buying Tulip's in the 1600's, before the market crashed. It's about knowing when to get out, when will the people tire of this fad. 

I wish I had bought Bitcoin in the early days - that makes sense. But I don't think I would have profited much as I would have cashed in once my money had gone up a little. 

Bitcoin just doesn't work as anything other than a commodity like Gold, Silver or even Tea. But if Bitcoin fails it goes to nothing unlike the other commodities. It doesn't exist, it's just numbers on a Blockchain. If the central bank makes its own digital currency, then that will make a lot of investors drop out of Crypto's. Bitcoin only keeps going up if new investors can be convinced it will make them money, Every fad has its end time, I think this time, like the Tulip buyers time, is fast approaching.

If you already have Bitcoin, you should wait until you are in profit and then get out. But you shouldn't wait for ever as you could be making money with the Bitcoin money invested elsewhere. Sometimes you have to go backwards before you can go forwards again. 

I think in ten years time all you will hear from the buyers is, ""I wish I had sold mine earlier"".",My thoughts about Bitcoin.,0.17

DJ Elf made this video to explain a tool I built called Rep My Block so we, as Americans, can beat at the ballot box those that don't understand the Freedoms values embedded in Bitcoin *(and those* ***not American interested in bringing democracy*** *into your clans, D/M me)* 

I have been fighting in New York since 2013 and this short from two days ago is a fight at a political meeting that started in 2014: [***https://youtube.com/shorts/dd81\_OAx2wI***](https://youtube.com/shorts/dd81_OAx2wI?feature=share) *(I am the one with the bullhorn in the video.)*

As you can see in the NYC Post Election, a quasi-governmental entity want to outlaw Bitcoin political donations *(click on recommendations)*: [**https://www.nyccfb.info/media/reports/2021-post-election-report**](https://www.nyccfb.info/media/reports/2021-post-election-report/)**.**

**Recommendation #1:** Prohibit campaigns from receiving  cryptocurrency donations Cryptocurrency should not be an accepted  contribution method because of the unnecessary risk it poses to our  compliance and enforcement regulations. 

The following text below is for each one of us to get involved in defending bitcoin based on each other time, abilities, and desire to fight for bitcoin without resorting to schemes.

**We can beat them as long as we are willing to debate** in the room that matter, and it doesn't require storming Capitol Hill like those idiots on January 6th, but actually **at home talking to our neighbors.** *(Several of these idiots are my friends, but having to walked several bitcoiners to doors of the jailhouse, I know the drill now.)* 

If you want to understand more about what happened in the meeting, this DA candidate came to her first meeting and filed this series of a tweet of the meeting *(go up to see the short videos)*:  [**https://twitter.com/elizaorlins/status/1575647205272485888?s=20&amp;t=6Zi7Oh-QQfRW7mm8Iz6k0g**](https://twitter.com/elizaorlins/status/1575647205272485888?s=20&amp;t=6Zi7Oh-QQfRW7mm8Iz6k0g)**.**

The same type of meeting takes place all over the world, even in the DPRK *(but good luck coming out alive if they disagree with you.)* You just need to know where it is and that is where Rep My Block come in.

**The fight is not over, but I lay the pieces over the years.**

I explained to Nebraskan Bitcoiners how to make a show of force at their capitol (without storming it) and they defeated the Nebraskan Bitlicense!

2. They know the threat and have a big plan to squash it but just waiting for the right time. We may not know when it is, probably when a big country announces it as a reserve currency OR when price reaches 100k or it could be anything. They are just waiting to squash it...

       - if this is it, then are we screwed? They have the military, power, money and the squashing may be anything.

\[b\]The Problem\[/b\]

Every time you create a new BTC wallet, you’ll get a 12 word 'recovery phrase' that needs to be noted down and hidden somewhere, which - to me at least - \[b\]seems like a pretty gaping security gap\[/b\]. It doesn’t matter whether you write the words down and hide them in your attic, or stamp them on metal and bury them in your garden, the ‘master key’ to your wallet is still just sat somewhere, hoping that no-one finds it. If someone does find it, they can empty your account, and there’s no way you can stop them.

\[b\]A Quick Definition, for the Uninitiated:\[/b\]

A \[b\]seed phrase, seed recovery phrase or backup seed phrase\[/b\] is a list of words which store all the information needed to recover Bitcoin funds on-chain. Wallet software will typically generate a seed phrase and instruct the user to write it down \[u\]\[b\]\*on paper\*.\[/b\]\[/u\] If the user's computer breaks or their hard drive becomes corrupted, they can download the same wallet software again and use the paper backup to get their bitcoins back. (From: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed\_phrase](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase), with my emphasis)

\[b\]My Inspiration\[/b\]

A friend of mine told me about his ingenious technique for storing his recovery phrase, as I will detail below:

The ‘key’ here was that the notation he actually 'stored' referred to a favourite book of his, which was \*unknown\* and \*not written down\*, neither along with the recovery phrase ‘key’ (which I’m going to call ‘keynote’ to save time from now on) nor anywhere else. 

For the purposes of the example, let’s say the book was Moby Dick, 1987 edition by Penguin House. Critically, no-one knew the book, so it would be close to impossible for a stranger to crack the code.

His keynote looked as follows:

17, 12, 4

48, 6, 8

174, 8, 1

...and so on…

Each line in this key was formed of a triplet that referred to the page, line and word-number of a specific word, which, when looked up (using the exact correct book), was in fact the relevant ‘recovery word’. In 12 lines, he’d noted all 12 of the words in his recovery phrase without actually giving anything away to a casual reader/attacker. So long as the attacker didn’t know the book it referred to, the recovery phrase would be secure.

In my mind, this seemed pretty impressive. Feel free to use it, substituting his book (which I in fact made up) for your own. BUT don’t forget it needs to refer to a \*specific edition &amp; publisher &amp; date\*, because each edition will be different, and will give wildly different outputs for any given keynote.

The downside to this method is, you’ll have to spend some time actually \*finding\* each of your keywords in your favourite book, and you might have to cross your fingers that the book in fact does contain the word \*at all\*. It probably will, but it might not, and it might take you a while to actually find it. Either way, it’s a bit of a ball-ache. As you can see, the method still has some weaknesses. 

\[b\]A New Solution\[/b\]

I created a secret, unknown Github persona, and this persona has uploaded the \*entire\* bank of 2048 potential Bitcoin recovery phrase words, \[b\]in randomised order\[/b\], in 256 rows of 8, to a repo.  \*I\* know the name of this account, and the name of the specific repo, but an attacker wouldn’t. My keynote now looks something like this:

13, 7

24, 0

…and so on…

Each line refers to the ‘line’ and ‘word number’ referring to my unique words in my recovery phrase. This seems pretty secure to me. 

BUT we’re not quite finished. 

Firstly, given that I think I might be the only person who’s done this, it probably wouldn’t be too hard for a smart person to find my ’secret’ account and, if they had access to my keynote, steal my Bitcoin.

\[b\]So Why the Post?\[/b\]

I want to scale this concept so that everyone can use it \*and\* improve security even further - for all of us. There’s a couple of ways we could do it:

1 - Anyone and everyone could do the same as I did, creating their own repo and pushing a randomised list of recovery words. They could then note their own recovery phrase, in the form of a keynote as described above, secretly referencing their own Github repo. Please feel free to go ahead and do that if you want 🙂.  

OR, even easier (but maybe less secure?!), I could do the following:

I could link my not-so-secret account below, and anyone and everyone - hopefully lots of people - could fork the repo and make their \*own\* randomised version of the 2048 seed word list.

It would literally just be:

\* Fork my repo

\* Run something like ‘randomised\_seed\_words.shuffle’ locally

\* Push your new randomised list to your repo

That way, we each wouldn’t necessarily need to use our own account as our personal ‘referent’. In fact, you could pick a random forker and use \*their\* repo as your referent. No-one would ever know which repo you eventually chose as a referent, so it would make it \*pretty damn secure\*.

\[b\]NEXT LEVEL SHIT\[/b\]

Here’s where it could get really cool. 

I’m sure there’s someone out there in the community who could help build this, as I don’t think it’s particularly complicated technically. Sadly, however, it’s a little above my technical competence.

We could extend my repo in the following way:

\* Have it spin up a micro cloud instance on something like AWS/Google Cloud/Heroku etc (it would need to be free so that lots of people fork it and create their own version without having to spend any money)

\* Every day, say at midday UTC, the cloud instance would awaken, create a new, randomised version of the 2048 bank of ‘recovery’ words, and push it to my Git repo.

Ideally, it would be even further extended so that \*anyone\* could fork it, and just add their own unique details (their Github name, unique repo address, login details for Git &amp; whichever cloud provider we choose).

In this way, we could (hopefully!) have thousands of people all providing their own version of the randomised recovery words, \*AND\* a new version would be posted to \*each\* account \*every day\*, creating \*lots\* of potential ‘referents’.

What this would mean would be that, for \*even higher\* levels of security, not only could you choose a random account as your referent, you could also choose a random \*day\* too, so that there would only be 2 ‘keys’ for you to remember - a Github ID and a date, the ‘day of push’ - which you would memorise, never write down, and keep as your truly ‘secret' keys. 

I hope I’m making sense.

If this existed, my secret phrase notes might look very similar as they do now:

13, 7

24, 0

…and so on…

BUT what the attacker would have a \*super\* hard time discerning would be that, in fact, this ‘keynote’ refers to ShiftyDude6102’s ‘BTC\_randomised\_recovery\_words' repo, and specifically to the push that was made on the 5th April 1975 ;). 

I’m not sure it could get much securer than that. 

The only risk I can see is that the person whose account/repo/date-of-push you rely on might delete their account, thus making your keynote refer to a non-existent push. I guess we should therefore ask plebs to only fork the code if they commit to never deleting their account. 

In short, if someone could help me with the cloud infrastructure bit, and we could get just a slice of the users of this forum to fork a version to their own repo, add their own personal account details (git and whatever Cloud service we choose to use) and have it make daily pushes of the randomised bank of recovery words, we’d all have a huge set of potential dictionaries from which to derive our security / to which our keynotes could refer, making it possible to close what \*I\* believe to be the biggest, most insanely broad attack vector of \*how and where to store your recovery phrase\*.

And, finally, even the people stamping things on metal could take advantage of this, since they could just stamp number pairs instead of entire words onto their thingy-mabobs.

I hope that makes sense. Sorry if it was a bit long. Feedback, as always, very welcome.

If you got this far, thanks for reading! 🙂

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[b\]TL:DR\[/b\]

\[i\]\* Rather than store your BTC wallet’s ‘seed recovery phrase’ as brute words, which seems insanely insecure to me, you could pick your favourite book and store 12 triplets of \[page, line, word-number\], thus massively improving your security

\* Rather than using a book, you could push a randomised list of the 2048 recovery words to git. In 'real life' you would only need to store 12 number pairs in the format \[line, word-number\]. It would be even better if you did this with a secret, pseudonymous Github account.

\* If someone could help me make this into a simple forkable ‘product', that could spin up a micro cloud instance and have it push a new bank of randomised recovery words to the associated repo \*every day\*, and possibly even allow others to fork it and do the same using their own unqiue credentials, it could become a super secure, broad resource that all Bitcoiners could use as a referent when storing the 12 words of their recovery phrase.

Senator from the United States: Governments Cannot Seize **Bitcoin**

In a recent interview with Natalie Brunell of Hard Money, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) discussed bitcoin.

The senator from Wyoming praised bitcoin's benefits, mentioning that it cannot be halted, saying, ""I love that it can't be stopped especially because I'm concerned about our national debt."" Concerning inflation, I'm worried.

I see folks in my home state of Wyoming going to food banks now because they need fuel, they need gasoline to get to their jobs, and they now have to choose between expensive gasoline and food, so they are going to food banks for their food, she continued.

The senator went on to say, Therefore, we really need to look at assets that are going to be there for the long term when we see things that are inflationary, when we see the value of a dollar decline when you go to the grocery store and you come out with one sack of food instead of coming out with two for the same amount.

She went on to say that in some nations with unstable governments, the government may come and seize people's houses and property. The senator emphasized that the government could not seize Bitcoin.

According to the senator, that is unquestionably a safety net and something that individuals living in really unstable areas of other countries can confidently rely on to be there in the morning when they wake up.

Together with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the Wyoming senator introduced the ""Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act"" in June (D-NY).

According to Lummis, who provided an update on the measure, it is a very extensive piece of legislation—possibly too complex, considering the amount of time left in 2022 for it to be passed. But that gives us more time to gather more feedback on the law, and we want to welcome that, she continued.

I am quite new to bitcoin (a year now) and it is actually the first time I am writing something on Reddit. I did some research, I am using a cold wallet and try to dca a small amount on btc only and I just start using LN on a non custodial mobile wallet. 

I already went through similar subjects but my main issue is not the fear of losing access to my cold wallet but more a risk analysis to allocate a small pourcentage to an exchange to earn interests (Ftx 8% or Binance 5% apy on btc for example). I was thinking to allocate 90% on a cold wallet and 10% on exchanges. What do you think of this in a long term investment plan, is it too much/not enough ? I truly understand the concept of not your key not your crypto and the risk of exchanges but I try to dertermine a correct risk/reward balance (even if at the end I only invest a small amount that I can afford myself  to loose). 

Edit : after some extra research and almost a consensus on this sub, I will stick to 100% cold storage for all the different points discussed below. Thanks all for you advices and thoughts on this subject !",% btc to share between cold storage and exchanges with earning options,0.66

It has taken me a year to get my product ready (its a ticker display). But to get it in a reliable state to sell is a momentous  task, making sure everything is automated and smooth to customers.

So many things to consider to get up and running, especially doing on my own. from website design, Woocommerce set up, setting up hosting, payment processing, trying get it visible on Google shopping, SEO, marketing, business addresses, postage requirements, I'm absolutely exhausted.

I've only had one order through my website so far and they used Stripe Debit Card to pay lol, So gutted :). One of the hardest things is getting the website visible. So most of my orders have been through Etsy, I just wanted an alternative self hosted shop where I will be able to make it cheaper. And using Bitcoin for good.

Using a Raspberry Pi 4, the full node takes 700GB of space. Tip sync the bitcoin blockchain on a computer first, took around 10 hours. Used the same bitcoin core version as what BTCPayServer uses, then copied the data files over to the Pi4. As syncing only on a Pi I hear can take weeks.

Using Woocommerce with BTCPayServer integrated.

BTCPayServer has a nice interface to see invoices which get sent from Woocommerce and handles the processing

For me, it was the straw that broke the camels back on my narrow mindedness. I was never heavy but in the past year I had gained weight from over indulging on yummy food. I knew I could lose the weight if I wanted to just restrict how much I ate. I never liked restricting though. It has always been an annoying way to lose weight. Well this podcast episode finally made me break down my ideas of what weightloss and nutrition is. 

I started eating just meat, vegetables, and  fruit and I began drinking whole milk. I wanted to experiment and see what happens. It has completely changed how I feel and I have lost 15 pounds. I have 10 more to lose. Now I'm here completely in disbelief because I feel like I have been lied to my whole life about what is healthy and what is not. I dont get cravings for junk like i used to and my stomach always looks flat now. 

My main source of fuel is now fat from the steak I am eating 6 times a week. I cook using butter and coconut oil. I have fish or poultry for dinner and usually a vegetable for a side or potatoes. It is sad because I also know that a lot of people can't afford to eat the way I am eating.

I think bitcoin will help improve this but I wanted to share with my fellow bitcoiners that monetary manipulation has impacted our diets and many other things. Which is ultimately the point of the book the fiat standard. I just want you all to try to be healthier and live long to keep stacking sats and changing the world.",Bitcoin changed my diet,0.73

3678,1664914738,False,"To understand whether BTC mining is green or sustainable, it is first important to understand how a mining company describes its energy sourcing practices. Some ways to communicate sustainability involve claiming Bitcoin mining is “zero carbon” or “carbon neutral” but these are not the same thing.

Zero-carbon means that no carbon emissions were produced during the creation of a product or a service. Carbon neutral involves removing as much carbon from the atmosphere as was created, after it is created. This may be through carbon credits or offsets, i.e., payments to support activities that support the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, such as preserving or planting forests. However, the idea that carbon neutral is sustainable has been criticized because carbon credit/offset activities may not permanently reduce carbon. If carbon credits are used to protect one forested area, deforestation may increase in another area.

**Why Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption Is An Optimised Design By Nature**

Bitcoin’s energy consumption has been widely criticised. People claim that it is an outdated feature and newer, more modern blockchains have overcome that problem.

I wrote an article to discuss why it is a common misconception of Bitcoin. In fact, the article argues that Bitcoin’s energy usage is an optimal design choice which is based on scientific laws and forms the most critical component to make Bitcoin the most advanced and secure store of value.

3758,1664971353,False,"Here's part of the thesis:

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is open source. It’s decentralized. It’s free market. It trades globally 24/7. It’s permissionless. Its distribution is fixed and predictable. It’s pseudonymous. Verifiable. It’s impairment resistant. It’s a store of value, a currency, and a central bank, in one singularity. It’s full-stack is sophisticated, impossibly simple, beautiful. We can thank the 20 years of work from the cypherpunks that gave us encryption.

One of the major tenants the well read maxi's preach is that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, but allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.

So as the internet, blockchains, remote work, and the proliferation of English compose, the centers of power start getting distributed away. It's no longer a world that can even house dictators, or finance surveillance states or afford large scale corruption anymore. Lots of power gets returned to the people and maybe here we unlock our collective value.

I'm of the belief as well, that bitcoin lengthens people's time preferences, and does away with their mindless consumerism. Saving money, and having that money maintain its value from 1-5 years or even appreciate, will completely change people's minds and discipline. It's the mindless consumerism which has destroyed the environment and leads to climate change. Nobody will admit that though? It's the mad inflating dollars promoting this. Gov't has to give away dollars in Student Loan Forgiveness, how else can our young adults have a good time? They are lost in the black stuck hole of fiscal irresponsibility. Growth, growth, growth, how else can you outpace inflation? Spend that shit the moment you get it or start losing the moment you don't.

This is a crucially overlooked aspect of bitcoin. And since we run on 4-year election cycles, where the hell are you going to find the political capital to do the right thing and say party is over, we can't promote this growth and have a planet too. I can't keep spending trillions for my legacy and hand the bag off for the next President to do the same thing

Lastly, bitcoin mining is what will promote green energy to reduce its own liability, and capture energy waste. But mainstream talking points move in 24 hour cycles and innovation takes longer than that type of patience.

3781,1664988020,False,"As many are aware, the infamous faketoshi scammer Craig Wright has been on a campaign to use harassment, intimidation, barratry, and fraud to attempt to steal some 1.1M coins that belong to Satoshi and others.

In furtherance of this scheme his company just published code for directing the seizure of third party coins in the BSV blockchain.  BSV is a scammy bitcoin knockoff that is proprietary software controlled exclusive by Wright and his agents. Users of BSV are only permitted to run the software he approves so they're able to foist their coin stealing code onto their users which would be impossible for legitimate cryptocurrencies.

Because of this I believe any user of the BSV altcoin is in serious risk of exposure to network consensus instability or outright having their assets frozen or stolen out from under them.

This would be of no direct relevance to Bitcoin users except some Bitcoin exchanges support BSV and so far whenever an exchange has gone insolvent they've pooled assets from all users in the bankruptcy.   This means that if an exchange becomes insolvent due to Wright stealing or freezing BSV out from under it users Bitcoin balances may be used to make BSV customers whole.

While it's never a good idea to leave Bitcoins you aren't actively trading on exchange I'd strongly recommend getting your funds off the following exchanges ASAP (non-exhaustive list):

Here is the BSV official explainer video on their coin confiscation process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-thMjd7pKc

Of course, since the BSV ecosystem has been engaging in non-stop harassment of Bitcoiners including multibillion dollar lawsuits against Bitcoin developers and non-BSV supporting exchanges it's probably prudent to not to business with exchanges still supporting this ecosystem to begin with, if you care about the value of your Bitcoins'.

The US debt is massive, they're not going to pay for it with tax cuts, they are going to pay for it with printing. If you hold fiat, if you have contracts that promise to pay you later in fiat (e.g. bonds) then you will pay for that debt in proportion to that fiat exposure. It will be intentionally, by design, not clear the exact moments when that inflation takes place (e.g. when the printing happens, when financial assets show price increase, when land shows price increase, when bread does). If everyone knew exactly when fiat loses it's value, they'd dodge those losses. 

You can debate the morality of who racked up that debt, who should pay for it, what all that money bought, etc. But the facts are that you will pay it off and more in proportion to your fiat exposure and it will be hard to predict. Bitcoin isn't a good asset to speculate on and jump back to the 'safety' of fiat. Fiat is a ship guaranteed to sink, it just sinks slow since it's so big. Bitcoin is a non-sinking ship.

The events of Mt. Gox, Voyager, Celsius, etc... are well publicized and should convince many people to self custodian their own coins.

However, I believe user behavior won't change all that much because the product market fit for self custody is rather small.

A representative sample size of people willing to self custody might overlap with the demographic who currently choose to store the majority of their dollar bills at home (in a safe, under their mattress, etc...) instead of in a bank account. It might be tens of millions of people, but probably a small % of total population.

The vast majority of people choose to let custodians secure their cash, so it's safe to assume those same people will probably choose to let custodians secure their bitcoin keys.

I think we should always encourage people to self custody, but we can't force people to. Not everyone shares the same values, needs and priorities as you. Different strokes for different folks. Most people want to trust someone else with their money because they don't trust themselves. Other people just want to tap into the monetary network of bitcoin and don't care about the hassle of custodianing the asset. I see nothing wrong with businesses like Strike building centralized solutions for these people as long as customers understand the risks involved.

   Stop handing out predictions like it’s well thought out financial advice. The volatility in Bitcoin will remain for a long time. And it’s better for people to come for the technology, and stay for the financial benefits, then to be sold some story about getting rich quick and leaving when that doesn’t occur. Bitcoin has been and most likely will be well into the future a long term bet and a great technology early in its adoption.

[It’s now estimated that 10% of the world’s total electricity consumption is dedicated to the internet](https://physicsworld.com/a/powering-the-beast-why-we-shouldnt-worry-about-the-internets-rising-electricity-consumption/) as its been embedded into most facets of human societies. The aggregate costs of the internet aren’t questioned as they’re now part of an essential public utility. 

Enter porn. [Pornography has been a ubiquitous feature of humanity from ancient times.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_erotic_depictions) With the rise of a global communication network (the internet) porn was among the earliest and remains one of the most prevalent use-cases of the network. 

It’s estimated [that up to 30% of all data transferred on the internet is pornography.](
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/internet-porn-stats_n_3187682/)

Other [sources](https://www.livemint.com/Industry/VhuXq3jfADn2CrhK8nJ7pL/Oops-Indian-ISPs-telcos-could-lose-3070-of-data-revenue.html) show ranges between 30-70% of ISP traffic is pornography related traffic. 

There are a lot of numbers thrown around - some higher, some lower. But the general approximations shown above have decent evidence supporting the claims. And per those estimations, porn is responsible for somewhere north of 3% of total global energy. 

Even if porn is conservatively responsible for 10% of total internet usage, and the internet uses 10% of global energy, that means 1% of global energy is dedicated to pornography. 

Contrast that to bitcoin, [which consumes .16% of total global energy](https://youtu.be/S7xzISnSbXc), and things become clear. Bitcoin is a decentralized global money / property / utility. Porn isn’t.

4043,1665146215,False,"What Bitcoin Did is a podcast hosted by [Peter McCormack](https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack), and in this episode he is joined by [Nicholas Gregory](https://twitter.com/gregory_nico), the CEO of [Commerce Block](https://twitter.com/commerceblock), the company behind [Mercury Wallet](https://twitter.com/mercury_wallet).

They discuss how statechains can enable privacy, how to onboard BTC Lightning users, and look at the interface of Mercury Wallet.

Read our notes below to learn more.

# Background

* In the past, he worked as a TradFi developer for banks.
* In 2012 started to get into BTC.
* Went full-time around 2016.

# Statechains on Mercury Wallet

* Mercury Wallet produces statecoins in which BTC can be put in and then transferred.
* An address with two private keys is created, where one private key is with the user and one with the recipient.
* To transfer it to another wallet, the recipient should create a statecoin address in Mercury.
* There is cooperation between the sender and statechain server to tweak the sender’s private key and generate a new private key for the recipient.
* With the two private keys, you’re creating one public key which exists on the BTC blockchain.
* There is a 3-month time limit during which statecoins can be sent back and forth.
* Mercury is non-custodial and the users can always pull their funds out.

# Mercury Wallet Interface

* The deposit button allows users to create a statecoin.
* Withdraw button allows taking your BTC back to BTC main chain.
* Privacy Score in the pop-up window means how many times the state coin has been swapped.

# Criticism

* Some people don’t like the hardware security module (HSM) that the team is using.
* To avoid the risk, the team has hard coded the 3-month period.
* Every L2 has a reduction in trust compromises.

# Regulatory Concerns

* Different lawyers have different views.
* The team is trying to copy what others are doing.
* They don’t have custody, they don’t charge for using the swaps, and they charge only for using the statechain entity.
* FinCen released a report in 2019 stating that non-custodial mixers are ok to operate.
* Custodial mixers are in control of the funds and you need a money transfer license.
* The team has plans to protect themselves.

# Thoughts on Fedimint

* [Fedimint](https://twitter.com/fedimint) is different, it’s similar to [Liquid Network](https://twitter.com/Liquid_BTC).
* Mercury is fixed UTXO, which means that you can’t break the statecoin into little pieces.
* The next step for statecoins is to integrate with BTC Lightning Network.

# Mercury Use Cases

* Mercury currently has around 16 BTC going through the system.
* Statecoins could be used for Discreet Log Contracts.
* The team is working on being able to onboard Lightning users.
* In some ways, Mercury is better than [Wasabi wallet](https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet), in some ways it’s not.
* Mercury is not doing any type of coin join, it’s doing coin swaps, which means that the exchanges can’t see anything. The downside is you might get a dirty coin.
* The team wants the project to be seen as an L2 project rather than only a privacy project.

**TL;DR:** *After years of using Coinbase and amassing a large amount, my mother gave it all to thieves that convinced her they worked for Coinbase and her account was 'locked'. Now she won't report it beyond Coinbase's 'compromised account' report, and is afraid to tell anyone but me because she thinks they'll get divorced.*

Obviously a throwaway account but wanted to share my sad, developing story.

I've been into bitcoin as a fascination since 2010, didn't buy until 2012 at around $980, and ATH at that point. At some point, maybe 2017, 2018, my mother asked me if I knew what Bitcoin was.  This was surprising.  My parents are aging and use me as their IT go to, but it has always tumultuous because their retention of knowledge on this subject is zero.  For instance, I've shown them each how to upload photos from their phone at least three dozen times.  The processes never changes, they just are incapable of learning new things, unfortunately. I told my mother I would not be responsible for teaching her anything about bitcoin and she would have to learn on her own, then come back to me with real questions and we could talk about it.  I'm not a good teacher,  I'm not patient enough, I know this.

Ultimately she did some research!  I was impressed.  I was willing to have some discussions about it and I explained that the best thing for her was probably to use Coinbase because it's the most similar to online banking and maybe they'd be able to use it, safely.  My parents always have issues with remembering passwords.  They each ended up having multiple facebook accounts. I've considered a password manager but even that seems like a nightmare versus their writing 200 passwords down in a document.  They are obsessed with boogie men walking through their fancy neighborhood, getting on their wifi and 'stealing' their social security codes from the computer.  Insane edge-case stories that I ask where they get this from.  So they are aware of the dangers of hackers, identity theft.  That doesn't mean they understand it or can confront it at all.

If it sounds like I'm talking down to my parents, just understand that I'm trying to paint a picture of my digital life surrounding them for the past decade or so.  It's been trying and finally culminated with the event I'm about to get into. I still love them dearly, I just can't be there protect them from themselves 24/7.

As bitcoin rose and fell for the past decade, my mother would send me texts like ""Did you see the price of bitcoin!?"" and I'd say yeah, and we'd discuss philosophically what this could mean. It was actually kind of fun to have this discussion with my mother. One day though, I was home and we looked at her account.  The value of it was over $900,000!!!  This was near the recent ATH of over $50k.  I had no idea she had gone that far into this.  She is retired and has a bit of a nest egg.  I do my best not to discuss major finances with my family unless necessary.  This seemed dangerous to me.  I recommended that she at least liquidate her cash that had been put into the bitcoin and continue on with her crypto life. She didn't. It's her money, I was not going to get much more involved but I definitely felt uneasy. At one point, I had tried to get her on a trezor hardware wallet, but as you can guess from the above paragraphs, as I was setting it up, I realized this was never going to work for her.  And the last thing I wanted was for her digital assets to be locked onto a trezor because she fat fingered a password or digital key. Coinbase still seemed like the best bet, even though as we all know: not your keys, not your money.

This is the part that stings the most... I saw during the past year that Coinbase was having trouble. Lots of customer hacks and the company could even potentially fall like previous major exchanges have.  I did send my mother a text again reiterating that maybe it's time to diversify those assets, which had since dropped considerably in value due to such a difference in value of BTC. I wish I had pushed this harder.

Fast-forward to earlier this week.  I receive a call from my mother at an odd time.  She asked if I'm busy and if I'm sitting down.  I was.  Worried about a family disaster or accident, my heart started beating faster. ""My coinbase account was hacked and I lost it all""  .... I could not believe it. My heart sank. Let's remember, none of this was my money but the fact that I had been in the know all along the way weighed on me.  It still does.  I asked how this happened.  My mother wasn't even able to fully articulate what happened.  I think it had just occurred.  She said her account had been locked and she called the number on the website and talked to coinbase people but they ended up not being coinbase people.  What I surmised from our brief exchange was that she had been socially engineered to hand over all the information someone would need to get into another person's account and transferred it all their own wallet. She said it was all gone.  Matter of factly.  I wanted to scream, I wanted to ask how could you be so fucking stupid.  After all of the times I had in vain tried to warn her of the dangers of not being secure digitally. I was able to refrain from doing these things because I realized how this must feel.  To have what could potentially be her life savings gone in an instant. I just said, ""I'm so sorry."" And then I wanted to get details, but she had to go.

We've talked a few times since.  I don't live nearby, but I work and have young children.  I can't just pick up and go.  I wanted to go though, and just give her a hug.  She is adamant that I tell no one else. I've been doing some research and have been urging her to go to 'the authorities' to report this theft. She made some major bonehead mistakes, but she is the victim of a crime.  I keep telling her this. But she is embarrassed, obviously, and worried she will be put in the newspaper and her spouse will divorce her over this.  So now I am left baring the weight of this immense secret and devastating loss.

She says it's gone, there's no way to get it back.  If I was there, I would at least check the transaction log and try to follow the btc as best I could through the block chain. That's SOMETHING, but still, I am also a realist and know it's all gone. That's how this technology works.  It is agnostic, it is sterile, it is unforgiving.  This is not the world our parents grew up in and it's able to eat them for breakfast. It's so wild how long cons are definitely a thing of the past when you can do a quick con and become a millionaire in less than 5 minutes.

From what I've gathered in our brief discussions, this is what happened.  I am missing lots of details but wanted to share just as a warning for others that may be preyed upon.

1. She received a ""message"" that her coinbase account had been locked. I do not know if this is an SMS, email, toast message on a website.  I simply don't know, but I believe she clicked a phony link that sent her to a bogus coinbase locked screen.
2. On the bogus coinbase locked screen, she was prompted to call a number.  she unfortunately did, instead of calling me. Which I had told her anytime something seems 'off' just call me first.
3. On the call, they convinced her they were coinbase officials and would help unlock the account. They then, unbelievably, convinced her to download anydesk onto her computer and literally commanded the computer while they were on the phone.
4. Unclear on how much personal information she gave them, but potentially everything. email, phone, SS#, DOB, who knows.  I want to get this timeline written down and confirmed but can't do this until I am face to face with my mother.  I'm avoiding making her relive the details by recounting everything to me over the phone. I'm also worried that as time passes, she will forget the details.  
5. Unsure what happened after this, but perhaps after they got into the account and transferred the money, they simply hung up. At this point, my mother called me because she realized what had happened.

My guess is that had she just typed coinbase into her browser, or used an existing book mark, she'd have seen her account was not 'locked.'  My mother isn't web literate enough to understand the difference. I can't help but feel somewhat responsible for not protecting my mother from her own lack of knowledge and I feel incredibly guilty. She has forbade me from telling anyone else, and I'm doing everything I can to not get angry because all that will do is make her feel worse. I think we are both experiencing swift and sudden depression over this. She keeps telling me she can't believe she was so stupid. While I deep down want to scream the same thing to her, there is no benefit from berating her anymore. The damage has been done. 

I know this isn't over. I'm not sure what the long term impact of this upon my family will be.  Whether the 'secret' gets out, or doesn't, neither have great implications for the future of my family. I'm only sharing this because I have no other way to do so, I'm not looking for sympathy. Maybe a little compassion and maybe even some advice. I understand if some feel the need to kick dirt in my face over this, if that makes you feel better fine. Ultimately, I believe this needs to be reported, even though we won't get the bitcoin back.  By biggest fear is that coinbase suddenly 1099's my mother for the 'transaction' of bitcoin that wasn't even hers.  If you wait till tax season for that and don't report it, it will look like your' fraudulently trying to transfer away your bitcoin. As I've thought about this more and more, it's incredibly difficult to 'prove' that any of this happened because the paper trail will just look like a regular transfer.... of your entire wealth all at once after years of inactivity.  Also still not too weird in the world of crypto.  That's the beauty and danger of bitcoin.  Someone just spent 5 minutes conning my mother and is now potentially a millionaire.

I know nothing about Bitcoin. I'm going through a divorce and my wife found a number written down on a piece of paper in my office. I mainly use my PC for gaming and am always writing stuff down. The number was 695476. Somehow my wife is convinced this is something to do with Bitcoin. Her lawyer produced the enclosed document (jpg) at deposition and said it was my bitcoin. I went to the website [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) and entered the number, and it brought up a lot of information I don't understand. I need to somehow prove that this is nothing to do with me and that I have no bitcoin. Is there anyway you guys can tell me information about this transaction that can help? I know this is rather vague, but I really don't know what I'm even looking at, needless to say divorce is hard without accusations I don't understand and can't disprove!

In  short, first there was bitcoin but it didn't stop there. People who  wanted to print their own money without all that difficulty of playing  by the bitcoin rules started some clone currencies. Some even tried to add a little value in making their competitor and printing their own money. But that was too much work to  need to put in to print money, so there was an explosion of new coins on existing chains. But even that wasn't enough money  printing for people so people invented trading tokens on chains to make it just super easy to print.  All of these are efforts to make something of value from nothing that people will trade like money. All are just more money printing. Everyone wants to print money, not just the central banks. Crypto is trying so,  so hard to print money.

The  difference, of course, is that bitcoin doesn't have an owner, doesn't  allow rollbacks, doesn't have pre-mining, doesn't allow changes in  monetary policy. All the NFTs and ICOs and altcoins and central banks do. So no one gets to print bitcoin and that's why isn't a good currency  and those others are not.

ITS JUST FOR DISCUSSION PEOPLE, AINT S\*\*\* ELSE BEING POSTED RIGHT NOW

Scenario:

2024-2035

if CBDC's do somehow succeed or captures enough of peoples wealth (for whatever reason) to where governments can actually ban bitcoin purchase simply because all the money is CBDC and bitcoin didn't spread fast enough and large amount of supply is held by whales BUT people see the need and want bitcoin. Lets assume this is also an All In attack aswell meaning this is the one and only strike and every government is onboard or forced , military involved in civil unrest. Worst case scenario. Food is leveraged against people along with large monetary incentives to suppress others. Unable to download wallet apps from IOS/android.

Solution:(obviously not just this one, there are many solutions to a problem)

I would want to suggest the Greater Good theory to the community, mainly those who manage to understand and accumulated a significant amount of bitcoin to this point. People wont have much to give you in return if anything at all or able to work / take time to provide you an adequate service but i suggest to fight this problem we simply have to spread / give away Sat's to those in need to save Bitcoin and continue onboarding with what's left. In many different ways like sending 1 or 100 sats to all bitcoin addresses , those with nodes help people create wallets. Its all going back to the roots and manual way of doing things and word of mouth. underground / secret communities that use bitcoin and offer people escape by giving them bitcoin and connections to others they can transact with.

4186,1665261511,False,"# Summary and TL;DR

**Blockchain ""throughput""** is often measured in Transactions Per Second (TPS), but transactions are a poor indicator of useful actions. It's counterintuitive, but on blockchains with high percentages of **batch transactions** like Bitcoin, **the most efficient blocks actually have the lowest TPS**.

For example, the theoretically most-efficient 4M WU Bitcoin block would consist of 1 single transaction packed with 32250 individual 31-vByte P2WPKH Bech32 UTXO output addresses. This would make Bitcoin a 0.002 TPS network despite performing at a much-higher **53.7 useful Transfers Per Second (TfrPS)**, which is a better metric for useful actions.

In this analysis of over 2 million Bitcoin transactions, I determined that if Bitcoin's blocks were 100% filled, its TPS throughput given the current mix of transaction types is a disappointing **3.9 TPS**. This is a major limitation because if even 1% of the world's population used Bitcoin, they would only be able to make 1 on-chain transaction once every 240 days. However, this metric is misleading due to batch transactions.

**About 20% of transactions on the Bitcoin network use batching, and this is enough to effectively increases useful throughput from 3.9 TPS to 16.8 TfrPS** (still slow, but noticeably higher).

(While this analysis focuses on Bitcoin, other blockchains are also able to do this. But this post is already too long to include a comprehensive analysis of multiple blockchains. This was researched to the best of my knowledge. Please let me know if you spot any errors.)

## Intro - Throughput Benchmarks

**Throughput** is the rate at which data travels through a network. For cryptocurrency networks, this is often measured by **Transactions Per Second (TPS)** because that's the easiest metric to measure on all networks, and the data is ubiquitous. But this is an inadequate measurement of throughput because it doesn't reflect the true rate of **useful actions**.

**Benchmarks**: For gaming computers, there is no single benchmark that covers everything. Instead, they are divided into many different categories such as: single-CPU, multi-CPU, 2D graphics, 3D graphics, physics, ray-tracing, etc. There are also composite benchmarks that attempt to estimate typical usage like: office use, gaming use, watching media, video editing, 3D modeling. One way of benchmarking crypto throughput is to divide into different types of ""useful actions"".

**Useful action**: A useful action could be a transfer, swap, NFT mint, contract create/destroy, deposit/withdrawal. For batch transactions, a single batch transaction could contain 5000 useful actions, and a single contract could create 100 NFT mints. So what looks like 1 TPS could actually be 5000 useful **Transfers Per Second**, which I'll call **TfrPS**.

**Useful action in Bitcoin**: Bitcoin does not support advanced smart contracts, so there is only one type of useful action: a transfer. You'd think it would be one of the easier blockchains to benchmark. However, this is far from true due to the numerous different types of addresses.

Bitcoin now has **P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2WPKH/P2WSH-within-P2SH, and P2TR addresses**, all with different input sizes, output sizes, and signature/witness sizes. This is due to the Bitcoin community's ridiculously unhealthy obsession with **avoiding hard forks** (e.g. the Segwit 4M weight fiasco that inevitably ended up splitting the community in a hard fork anyways). Each of the combinations of addresses and headers generates a different size of transactions, each with different TPS and TfrPS measurements. (So Bitcoin, please Go Hard FORK yourself and get rid of all these outdated, inefficient address types.)

About 20% of Bitcoin transactions are batch transactions, which I consider any transaction with more than 3 UTXOs. These are almost exclusively done by exchanges. I've personally noticed BlockFi and Gemini doing small batch transactions of \~10 UTXOs with my accounts, and Coinbase doing a 1:100 batch transaction with them.

## Analysis

**Tools**:

Most of my data is from blockchair.com, blockchain.com, blockstream.info, and btcscan.org for analyzing blocks and transactions. **Blockchair** was particularly useful because it provides a bulk TSV data download way faster than most API services. Gotta love the speed of traditional databases. I used **Google Sheets** to compile the results, which was annoyingly slow due to its 10M-cell limit, so I had to optimize by splitting calculations across multiple sheets. Lastly, I used [this calculator](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-size-calculator/) to double-check my work.

**Overall Measurements from the Blockchain**:

Overall, across **1271 blocks and 2.19M transactions**, there were 1.47B bytes, 3.82B weight units (WU), and 9.60B transfers. On average, the blocks would've been 1.54MB on average if full. The actual TPS with the partially-full blocks was 2.88. **Had the blocks been full, they would have seen a throughput of 3.9 TPS and 16.8 TfrPS.**

Transaction count varies as much as [10% from day to day](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions). However, the results after correcting for block fullness are quite stable.

* Daily TPS range: 2.8-3.2
* Daily TfrPS range: 11-13
* **Daily TPS with 100%-full blocks: 3.9**
* **Daily TfrPS with 100%-full blocks: 16.8**, which is 4.3x the max TPS

**What this means is that the Bitcoin blockchain is getting 3.3x more useful actions (TfrPS) than what the TPS metric suggests.**

[Frequency of Transaction Types](https://preview.redd.it/ewio9lb87ns91.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb0b04049414bd7df8760861a23bee9ca919783e)

**Transfers per Transaction**:

Most single-transfer transactions actually contain 3 UTXOs instead of 2 because there is a leftover change UTXO.

Within the 2M transactions, here's the percent breakdown of what kind of transactions were on the blockchain:

|**Batch Type**|**Frequency**|
|:-|:-|
|1:1|78.7%|
|2 Batch|6.9%|
|3 Batch|3.6%|
|4-5 Batch|3.4%|
|6-10 Batch|3.0%|
|11-50 Batch|3.0%|
|51-200 Batch|1.3%|
|200-1000 Batch|0.2%|
|1000+ Batch|0.0%|
|**Total**|100.0%|

## Size Details

**Block size**: Each Bitcoin block has a maximum of 4M weight units (WU), mined an average of once per 10 minutes or 6667 WU/s. On average, 75% of the daily block space was filled.

**Transaction weight** = 3x base size + 1x full size = 4x (header + inputs + outputs) + 1x witness size

## UTXO sizes (vBytes)

|**UTXO sizes (vBytes)**|**Description**|**Input Sizes**|**Output Sizes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P2PKH|Legacy 1x|148|34|
|P2SH|Legacy 3x script|153|32|
|P2WPKH|Segwit|68|31|
|P2WPKH in P2SH|Script-wrapped Segwit|91|32|
|P2WSH|Segwit script|68|43|
|P2WSH in P2SH|Script-wrapped Segwit script|103|32|
|P2TR|Taproot|58|43|

* These vByte sizes include the Witness size. Sometimes the size is 1-2 vBytes smaller due to the Witness having leading zeroes that get trimmed.
* ""**Scripts**"" are usually Multisig addresses
* Transactions also have a header, which is normally 10-11 vBytes.
* All the large batch transactions have a good mix of output address types because their recipients are random. On average, they're around 31-32 vBytes since Multisig and Taproot outputs are uncommon.

## Common Transaction Weights

These are the UTXO combinations I noticed the most often in the 400-1000 WU range. Almost all batch transactions fall beyond this range, and they vary too much in size to be included here. The largest ones were \~400000 WU.

* 437-439 - Segwit to P2WPKH (common)
* 441-442 - Segwit to P2SH (common)
* 449-450 - Segwit to P2PKH (common)
* 561-574 - Segwit to 2x various (common)
* 658-661 - P2SH to 2x various
* 756-764 - P2PKH to various
* 833-845 - 2x Segwit to 2x various
* 885-900 - P2PKH to 2x various, Segwit to 3x various

[​Distribution of Transactions by Weight Units](https://preview.redd.it/p6mx90y97ns91.png?width=855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bec556cd6d83863e53703929ea54a0991cfeae1)

## Theoretical Limits to Batch throughput

* **Common Segwit (P2WPKH) transactions**: You can increase throughput from 11.8 TfrPS to 53.7 by batching outputs, and from 11.8 TfrPS to 24.5 by batching inputs.
* **Common Wrapped Segwit (P2WPKH-in-P2SH) transactions**: You can increase them from 12.4 to 18.3 TfrPS with batch inputs.
* **Lightning** on-chain transactions use a 2/2 Multisig or P2TR Taproot address
* Note that **these are purely theoretical limits** because there will always be a mix of different types of transactions. You can't expect everyone to join into a single transaction. That would require everyone to use a single centralized exchange. And you can't expect users to only batch outputs, not inputs. This is why the real max throughput is 16.8, which is far lower than the theoretical limit of 53.7.

**Batching Outputs - Throughput**

|**Batching Output (1:n) TfrPS**|**1**|**2**|**5**|**20**|**200**|**MAX**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Segwit (P2WPKH)|15.2|11.8|28.5|45.3|52.8|53.7|
|Segwit script (P2WSH)|13.6|10.1|22.7|33.7|38.2|38.7|
|Wrapped Segwit (P2WPKH in P2SH)|12.4|10.0|25.4|42.7|51.0|52.1|
|Legacy (P2PKH)|8.7|7.4|20.3|37.8|47.7|49.0|
|Legacy script (P2SH)|8.5|7.3|20.6|39.4|50.5|52.1|

**Batching Inputs - Throughput**

|**Batching Inputs (n:1) TfrPS**|**1**|**2**|**5**|**20**|**200**|**MAX**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Segwit (P2WPKH)|15.2|9.4|17.5|22.6|24.3|24.5|
|Segwit script (P2WSH)|13.6|8.7|16.9|22.3|24.2|24.4|
|Wrapped Segwit (P2WPKH in P2SH)|12.4|7.4|13.4|17.0|18.2|18.3|
|Legacy (P2PKH)|8.7|4.9|8.5|10.6|11.3|11.3|
|Legacy script (P2SH)|8.5|4.8|8.3|10.3|10.9|11.0|

## Side Notes

## Outliers

**Smallest transactions**: Technically, the smallest transactions are \[396-397 WU, 1:1 P2TR (Taproot) to P2WPKH\] transactions, but they're very rare (&lt; 0.5% of transactions), and they're not used in batch transactions. So they're not relevant to this analysis.

**Largest transactions**: Technically, the largest batch transactions date back to 2015. They each held 20000 transfers like this one: [30b3b19b4d14fae79b5d55516e93f7399e7eccd87403b8dc048ea4f49130595a](https://btcscan.org/tx/30b3b19b4d14fae79b5d55516e93f7399e7eccd87403b8dc048ea4f49130595a), but they were useless wasted block space sent to OP\_RETURN without any metadata.

Pseudonymous creator makes a world changing technology and doesn't take any of the rewards or recognition. Truly living the ethos of his invention. It's amazing story that is easy to fall in love with. It resonates deeply for humans who love archetypal heros. Sacrificing for the cause, Satoshi was pure in his motives and created Bitcoin in an altruistic manner. A selfless hero in this genesis story.

Satoshi is/was obviously a polymath with the ability to combine a wide ranging knowledge base across many fields to create Bitcoin. Given his or the groups demonstrate genius, wouldn't it be possible he/she/they understood that for a new invention to take over as global currency it needed a narrative that would breed passion and an almost religious level fervor. 

Because to take on the pushback from all the incumbents for this new Monetary asset would not be for the faint of heart. Much of Governments and all of central banks power resides in fiat currency. Replacing fiat currency with a decentralized currency threatens a major pillar of power —the control of money — for these institutions. To have the resolve to back Bitcoin to the degree needed for victory, a story so memorable, so pure had to be woven around the code. This human part of Bitcoin is just as powerful as the network itself. I think Satoshi knew a “myth” needed to be built around bitcoin for its full potential and adoption to be realized.

LocalBitcoin is a P2P platform allowing users to buy and sell bitcoin between each other. Regarding registration, if you are comfortable with providing personal information, email, phone and ID verification is required to create an account. Once verified, users can post a customised trade highlighting trading amount, exchange rate and payment method.

When a buyer buys bitcoin, the equivalent of the trading amount is held in escrow, once the seller has excepted the trade the escrow is released and sent to the seller.

Due to bad actors/scammers it is important to stay vigilant on LocalBitcoin. If you care to be extra safe, you could check the vendors trading reputation and if they are fully identified. Never close a trade outside of LocalBitcoin, it is extremely risky and customer service will not be able to help if the trade is unsuccessful.

* Remove the upvote/downvote button on social media.
* Replace it with just a single `like` button.
* In order to use the like button it would cost a SAT. ^(or perhaps any number of SATS.)

It would still have the same spam/bot fighting ability as the orange check mark.  It just moves the cost from a user having to **register** an account.  To a user having to **support** others.
* bots/spam content sucks, so people don't upvote the spam, since the spam gets no upvotes it isn't upgraded in the algo and gets showin to the world.
* even if there are tons of bots, they have their power striped and can no longer influence the algo much. as in order to vote it would cost the bot account a SAT.

I initially came to this idea from thinking about how to propagate good ideas over bad ideas.  My surface thinking goes,  good ideas are profitable,  so over time good ideas out compete bad ideas,  the people who make decisions off good ideas, I'd expect to be more wealthy than those who make decisions off poor ideas. thus continuing the propagation of the better ideas.  this is getting super wordy sorry if that didn't make a clear point. TLDR: create a market out of a social media timeline,  good products out compete bad products.

Not much interesting happened this week, 34 BTC were traded (30 BTC last week), almost the same value of the last weeks, around 120 BTC monthly (As I always said, it was over 2k BTC in 2018... WEEKLY!)

One BTC is around 170,000 Bs

LocalBitcoin is not that used anymore that is one of the reasons of the drop, Binance, AirTM and Reserve took its place! Binance is king because it has P2P with Bolivares (Bs. our national currency). Only advantage of LocalBitcoin it makes its stats public!

Monthly minimum wage is under 16 USD. Average is around 100 USD monthly, a good wage (like manager) is around 400 USD!

Inflation has slowed down and now it's around a ""nice"" 10% monthly, which is so good considering we had 2,000,000% yearly rate inflation in 2018!

(Waiting for September numbers, but should be around 8-12%)

Crypto has been used for years so people would exchange their Bolivares as soon as possible! Some people use them to send remittances to their families here and also people mining (house electricity is free, here mining with GPU is still profitable hahaha and with ASIC, even more!).

The agenda includes everything from the economy to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, Bitcoin is also a topic of discussion in the Georgia governor's election.

Shane Hazel, a libertarian politician and prominent supporter of bitcoin, is running for governor of Georgia. In order to lessen the influence of the government over the world economy, he is well recognised for his support of the largest cryptocurrency.

According to Fox News 5, the contender for governor may garner enough support to force a run-off in the Georgia governor's election.

## Election chances for Hazel

Individual freedom is the main component of Hazel's platform. Like every libertarian politician, he seeks to lessen government meddling in private affairs and taxation. In addition to legalising marijuana, he wants to abolish property and income taxes. He favours the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, which is consistent with his libertarian philosophy.

It is unlikely that the libertarian will prevail despite his claims. Only 2% of respondents in recent polls support his campaign. Brian Kemp, the incumbent governor of Georgia, is now in the lead with 50% of the vote, followed by Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, who has 45%. 3% of the population is still unsure.

Hazel can force a run-off with the election still a month away. To be declared the winner of an election in Georgia, a candidate must receive 50% plus one vote. In the event that no candidate passes this threshold, a runoff election featuring just two candidates is held. Hazel wants to have a say in the anticipated runoff.

## Midterm Results' Effect on Crypto

The midterm elections are crucial for the cryptocurrency industry. According to the most recent sources, if the Democrats maintain control of the Senate, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen may leave the Biden administration.

According to The Times, MPs might strive to boost the economy in the run-up to and following the election. The cryptocurrency market may experience a big rise in such a scenario.",Georgia's Pro-Bitcoin Governor Candidate Will Pass a Significant Milestone,0.5

### Why Does Robert Kiyosaki Buy Bitcoin?

In a few tweets on Friday, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki outlined his rationale for buying bitcoin.

The 1997 book Rich Dad Poor Dad was co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been a New York Times best seller for more than six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold worldwide in more than 51 different languages.

The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad stated in a tweet that he buys bitcoin because pension funds do the same. He quoted a Forbes article with the heading ""Your State Pension Is Now Betting On Cryptocurrency"" that contained a poll indicating that 94% of American state and local government pensions are investing in cryptocurrencies.

The survey is a part of the most recent Investor Trust Study, which was published in April by the CFA Institute, a global network of investment professionals. Two-thirds of institutional investors reported that they currently invest in cryptocurrencies, which indicates that this practise is becoming increasingly common. Government-sponsored pension plans are also the ones that are most likely to invest in cryptocurrencies.

In another tweet, Kiyosaki discussed the justification for his recommendation to purchase gold, silver, and bitcoin. The eminent scholar stated that the pension problem demonstrated central banks' failure to keep inflation under control. Despite previously investing in gold and silver, he said that pension funds are now also doing the same with bitcoin.

The Bank of England informed legislators that many pension funds were only hours away from collapsing when it made the decision to interfere in the British bond market last week in response to a massive sell-off of U.K. government bonds.

In his tweet, Kiyosaki stated that ""fake currency, stocks, and bonds are toast,"" and that pension funds are aware of this. Recently, the well-known author urged investors to put their money in ""real money,"" citing gold, silver, and bitcoin, and issued a dire warning that the end of fake money is at hand.

The renowned author has long recommended acquiring bitcoin in addition to gold and silver. Last month, he advised investors to buy cryptocurrency before the biggest drop in history. He said he was waiting for bitcoin to test the $1,100 level in June.

Last week, he projected that as long as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates, there would be opportunities to purchase gold, silver, and bitcoin. He also predicted that the US dollar would depreciate by January of the following year",Robert Kiyosaki Justifies His Bitcoin Purchases with Reference to Pension Funds and Inflation,0.38

Average CPI inflation rate over the period is ~2.5%. 

Which figure is closer to “true” inflation rate in your opinion? Both are reductive but the simple definition of inflation is growth in the money supply. I would argue 7.2% is closer since the CPI baskets have been known to be “gamed.”

SP500 returns have averaged ~9.1% over the period, if that 7.2% inflation rate is more accurate the US economic growth seems to be far overstated. It also means US bond yields have been negative in real terms for a long time. Salaries/cash savings have been devalued much faster than assumed, benefits don’t go nearly as far as they did. The US has been the strongest economy/currency in the world over the period, and this is how we are holding up?

If we can expect an even higher inflation rate going forward things look pretty bleak. It doesn’t seem like the FED will have any choice but to go back to QE and printing since these rapid hikes have been putting economies globally at risk and absolutely destroying foreign currencies. Some countries have already begun resuming QE. Is it even possible for the US to hike above rates of 7-10% again without total implosion? 

It really feels like all these macro factors globally are the perfect environment for Bitcoin to show it’s utility and purpose. Satoshi’s prescience is really incredible the timing of Bitcoin is truly remarkable.

4462,1665453417,False,"A bit of a mind-dump here, and interested to hear some ideas. 

I have been studying Bitcoin for a while now and have a very small and minute holding of the asset. I simultaneously believe the optimistic future presented by Bitcoin, but at the same time possess a pessimistic undertone when I consider the reoccurrence of the asymmetric distribution of power that could be sustained or produced by Bitcoin. 

I have a desire to invest in Bitcoin, because it has the potential to make me wealthy in the future (I don’t think I need to go into the details of why wealth is desirable, it is quite obvious). However, and this is a large “however”, can I be sure that my decision to invest in Bitcoin is “morally just”? 

Several question I still have: 

1. Outside of my short-medium term financial gain through Bitcoin, what are higher reasons that I should be investing in Bitcoin? Can Bitcoin actually create a “fairer” world?
2. If human prosperity is based on the fundamental principles of private property rights, is this “assumption” true? 
3. Can Bitcoin as a source of wealth, approach more egalitarian distribution across time? In other words, is Bitcoin able to prevent the current growing wealth gap across the globe? 
4. How does Bitcoin function in a divided world? In other words, can Bitcoin create understanding between the left and the right and operate along the “Middle Path”? 

Ultimately, I think the discussion of Bitcoin is a philosophical one concerning: Epistemology (How do we know what we know?), Metaphysics (what is real?), and Ontology (what is the nature of existence?), these ologies determine our assumptions (variables) for what is best for humanity. 

Even if we take the position and assume that inequality is part of the nature of reality, such that it is an undeniable fact (portions of the left may disagree with this). Shouldn’t we still strive to make it a human right for all individuals to have sufficient resources and support to fully flourish and self-actualise? (The left and the right could probably both agree on this). My problem is that, currently I am not completely convinced that Bitcoin can provide this desirable future.

The federal reserve put somethick silicone paint over the hole they say this patch work will last forever, but ~~economist~~ naval experts say the paint is only meant for a temporary fix.

I have looked into the Ledger and here is a quick overview: 

A closed source hardware wallet where you have control over your private keys. 

The Ledger uses a component called Secure Element, a type of chip also incorporated in passport, payment systems, credit cards etc with the intention to provide an extra layer of security. The chip is designed to protect our data while implementing a high resistance to hacking. In the case of the Ledger, it is used to generate and store private keys for the user’s assets. 

The Ledger Nano S supports around 107 cryptocurrencies and more than 100 tokens and appears to be better for beginners allowing users to manage up to 3 currencies at once. The Ledger Nano X supports more than 1100 cryptocurrencies, it offers a larger screen than the Nano S and extra features such as possible Bluetooth functionality and the ability to manage up to 100 coins at a time.

**Possibility #2:**  (I \*think\* this would work, but would like some feedback)

The NEW CTO generates a new seed phrase and generates a new master key and shares his master key with the three other signers.  

The three existing signers re-use the same seed phrase and re-use their master public keys.    They share their original master public keys with the new CTO.  

A new ""wallet"" is generated w/ the original master public keys from, CEO, CFO, Controller and new Master Public Key from the NEW CTO.

What should be done with the old wallet?   Once the funds are transferred out of that ""old wallet"", what should happen to the ""old wallet""?

## On-board nocoiners via tips without losing your sats.

## Project Scope:

A web app that allows bitcoiners to tip nocoiners via the lightning network with a super lightweight on-ramp interface and user flow. Nocoiners can claim their sats by scanning a QR Code and validating their phone number, they can then withdraw their sats to their desired lightning wallet once they are educated. The web app will require the functionality of adding expiration dates set by the sender in case the user does not withdraw their sats they will be returned back to the sender.

## Problem:

There is no quick and easy way to tip bitcoin to a nocoiner without teaching them how to download and set up a bitcoin lightning wallet. When someone gets tipped either at a restaurant or for any service provided there isn’t much time to be spent going through a whole lightning wallet onboarding process. Another concern is lost sats to nocoiners who might eventually lose access to their wallet access.

## Solution

A super lightweight onboarding ramp to send and receive bitcoin as tips for nocoincers. Send a tip and all the receiving user has to do is scan a QR Code, and open up a web app to claim the tip using their phone number via 2FA. The tip is set with a withdrawal expiration day, if it is not claimed or withdrawn within a set period of time the funds are refunded to the sender‘s wallet.

## Sender user flow

- Login via LN Wallet - ([LNURL-auth](https://github.com/chill117/passport-lnurl-auth))
- Create Tip -
    - Create a new shallow wallet
    - Create LN invoice
    - Set expiration time period
    - Fund invoice
    - Generate QR Code (Shallow wallet + funds to be claimed)
- Sender Dashboard with tip redemption status
    - Claimed
    - Withdrawn
    - Refunded

## Receiver user flow (Onboard)

- Scans QR Code
- Opens up web app with the tip amount
- Claims tip via Phone Number
- 2FA is sent for phone number verification
- A shallow wallet is linked with a phone number
- Show sats balance (currency balance) + redemption expiration countdown
- Withdrawal functionality to lightning wallet

## Off-boarding User

- Education guides for the following actions:
    - Withdraw funds to a wallet
    - Spend funds at lightning enabled sites or stores
    - Donate funds to users
    - Load funds to a virtual visa card
    - Spend sats to read articles",Gift sats without losing them ✨,0.78

4614,1665534841,False,"Bitcoin has cypherpunk / libertarian / anarchist roots. Over the years of growth and adoption, the variety of actors has grown and it is now being embraced by traditional financial institutions.

When I listen to people like Kevin O'Leary who say Bitcoin needs regulation, because of the sovereign wealth funds and whatnot need it, it admittedly makes me cringe. Sovereign wealth funds? WTF is that and who needs those?

He talks about auditors, regulators, compliance departments and all those things of the rotten legacy system I loathe and don't give two hoots about. I can't help but feel like some people view Bitcoin as yet another ticker - a symbol with a chart, like Amazon of Google stock that you trade and store on centralized exchanges or brokerages, without any regard for or understanding of what the underlying asset actually is, what values it represents, what lies behind it - the ingenious technology, the open-source community, the grassroots movement, the brave souls that fight for the most fundamental human right that is the sovereignty of the individual in the increasingly Orwellian world. He calls cypherpunks ""crypto cowboys"" and says ""we don't need their crap"".

If Bitcoin is to be yet another ticker, do we need it? We already have thousands of stocks, fiat currencies and commodities. You can trade them, long or short, all you want; adding one more doesn't make the world a better place.

Or does it? Maybe it does. For example, even regulated, it's still a hedge against inflation like no other, because its monetary policy is controlled by a decentralized protocol and unaffected by regulation. So there is this other part of me that's trying to see the positives of regulation.

Do I want Bitcoin to forever be this funny internet money that computer nerds use to buy pizza from one another, or do I want it to be more than that? The answer is: I want widespread adoption. I want to be able to use it everywhere and I want it to become the world's #1 currency/asset, because the more people use this freedom technology, the more people have freedom as an option. And yes, it will pump my bags, no shame in admitting that.

The good thing is, even if it's regulated for those who need or want regulation, it will never be regulated for those who use it the way it was originally intended to: on chain, p2p. Only centralized custodians can be regulated; the chain is decentralized and no regulation can change that. That's the beauty of Bitcoin: it can be a dual system, with centralized and decentralized parts, each serving its purpose and complementing each other to the degree that each individual actor desires (and centralization clearly has its uses; for one, it's efficient. I don't necessarily want to pollute the blockchain with every limit order I put in and pay tx fees for it; that's also the reason there are layer 2 solutions in crypto in general). Now, centralized doesn't necessarily mean regulated or KYC'd; the nature of Bitcoin as a 'sendable' asset (as opposed to an IOU) means I can send it to an offshore exchange where regulations are less strict or non-existent. This ability to send value freely creates a perfect environment for jurisdictional competition and arbitrage. Centralized coins go (over decentralized rails) where laws are what the users - and not the politicians - want them to be.

Institutions can hold their coins with regulated custodians, bringing tons of money into it and stabilizing the price. Traders can trade it on regulated exchanges providing liquidity and making the market more efficient. No harm in that. Maybe it's all meant to be part of Bitcoin's maturation. At the same time, I can send my coins permissionlessly to whoever I want - no one can take that freedom away from me - while benefiting from the adoption, stability and steady price growth.

Of course there is always the Tornado-type threat, whereby regulators declare the coins that have interacted with certain addresses tainted and prohibit exchanges within their jurisdiction from accepting them. But if they go too far, people can always move offshore or go 100% p2p. So it seems like a perfectly self-regulating system and on multiple levels; the closest to anarcho-capitalism mankind has ever seen. Like a subscription model whereby you choose which laws you want to abide by (and consequently, benefit from), and if someone tries to impose a law on you you didn't opt into, you show them your diamond middle finger.",It's interesting the variety of people who come to Bitcoin,0.78

I don't plan on leverage trading and stuff, just long-term investment stuff. 

1. Which on-ramp supports ACH transfers from credit unions? I opened my account in one of credit unions, get my salary on there, and I notice that in some apps that ask you to connect your bank account to it, they only have banks like M&amp;T, Bank of America, etc, but not smaller credit unions. So, I need an on-ramp which will support an ACH from my credit union.

2. Out of these on-ramps, which one has fair fees (~0.5% or less) and a fairly healthy amount of alt-btc pairs? My idea is to go heavily into btc until the next bull run, and when the dominance reaches 60% or more, and start declining, convert btc to alt(s) of my choosing, and then back to btc or USDC when dominance falls to ~40%. Then cash out to my credit union account.

3. I know that holding an asset for more than 1 year triggers long-term capital gains, but what happens if I hold btc for 2 years, then convert it to an alt, and sell the alt to usdc after 3 months.

This risk of outright ban by the government seems very limited, but often you hear the governments are not going to just let it happen. They will never take the risk of losing power over the monetary system.

But what would be the actual mechanism for banning bitcoin,  could it just be an executive order ? That’s what happened to gold.

The ability, in my opinion, to coordinate  a global ban on bitcoin is much less likely than a cascade of bitcoin held on the balance sheet of developed governments.

We all know that every price denominated in fiat will become less stable because fiat itself destabilizes. That also means that BTC/FIAT will become less stable. But somehow we now see that BTC/FIAT correlates with more other markets. Why is that? Think about it. 

If BTC/FIAT moves in tandem with *EverythingElse*/FIAT then what we can do is reprice *EverythingElse* in BTC. The result is a price in BTC for *EverythingElse* that is more stable than the FIAT price. 

The correlation makes it somewhat obvious to reprice things in BTC. We want that, right?

4739,1665609308,False,"Anyone else have their BlockFi Credit Card Bitcoin rewards payout this month not arrive yet? I get that they were closed on the 10th for Columbus day, which is the day we usually get our credit card rewards credited to our accounts, but it is now the 12th and I still haven't received my Bitcoin Credit Card Rewards. Anyone else? Or am I the only one?

I was so excited too since now I qualify for their 1 free withdrawal a month that applies for anyone who spends $100 dollars or more monthly on their Credit Card. Hope they're not having liquidity issues and going belly up.

I don't store any coins on them either, but do love their Credit Card Bitcoin rewards. Easy way to stack sats for money I was going to spend anyway. I double dip reward too by paying the BlockFi Credit Card off with my Coinbase Debit Card, which gets 4% back on that as an altcoin that I trade for BTC the second I get those rewards.

Easy way of getting 5.5% on everything I buy, since BlockFi gives me 1.5% back on anything I buy with their Credit Card, adding their 1.5% with Coinbase's Debit Card's 4% back, making a total 5.5% back on everything I buy in Bitcoin.

I get a chuckle at the idea that there is a chance, that in 30 years the Bitcoin rewards for everything I'm buying today, will potentially be worth more than the total spend I'll have made for those rewards by then. So hopefully there is just a delay in pay, otherwise I'll only be left with the Gemini credit card which I do use for dinning since they pay 3% for that, and groceries since they pay 2% for that, but if I used them for everything else I use my BlockFi card on they'd only pay 1% for that, lowering my BlockFi yield to 5% from 5.5% when accounting for the 4% by paying it off with my Coinbase Debit Card.

Funny enough, the Gemini Credit Card plus the Coinbase Debit card combine yield on dining becomes 7%, and 6% on groceries. Returns I could never get with traditional Credit Cards and Debit Card reward combos for my purchases I was already going to make anyway.

Side note, this is a great way to DCA without having to directly spend money for my coins.

Mechant number one only accepts Visa or Mastercard credentials through their point of sale machine. All they can do is accept bank cards.

Merchant number two has a point of sale machine that accepts credit card credentials too but they also accept lightning invoices as an alternative choice. By accepting lightning invoices they can accept payments directly from cashapp, strike, paypal, revolut, chime, nexo, every lightning wallet, every retail facing neobank app from any country, and potentially even Twitter Messenger Instagram and Whatsapp too. Soon all these apps will have the ability to pay to lightning invoices.

Why would a merchant only accept credit card credentials as a form of payment when they can accept payment from every single fintech app, every single lightning wallet, every single neo bank app, every single social networking app and every single messaging app on earth just by accepting one standardised invoice. Obviously the most competative thing a merchant can do is implement lightning as it allows them to accept payment from every single lightning compatible app on planet earth and soon there will be hundreds if not thousands of lightning compatible apps around the world.

A Bitcoin only, open source hardware wallet designed to be unhackable, allows you to set up a wallet, send funds and store BTC. With the NFC integration you can tap the ColdCard against your mobile phone to complete Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions. The ColdCard uses a Micro-SD card, this component enables you to back up the seed phrase without having to write it down as well as send outbound transactions without having to connect to the internet.

This device is designed to be extremely secure even down to its packaging. The ColdCard comes in a sealed plastic bag with a number on it, this number is also engraved permanently on the ColdCard board. Due to the transparent case, the number can be seen interiorly and should match the one displayed on the bag.

For those interested in using alongside other Bitcoin wallets, BlueWallet, Bitcoin Core, Electrum and Wasabi Wallet have built in ColdCard support to assist in signing transactions.

4824,1665665884,False,"I am searching about carbon footprint issue for a while. There is no doubt that we will hear more about it in the upcoming days, months. All around the world mostly big companies, goverments and ironically banks are making propaganda against carbon. They are telling we need to reduce the amount of carbon we produce because it is very bad for the global warming. But what actually happening is amount of the carbon in the air decreased dramatically over years. It is a neccesity for the nature. There must be a carbon balance for survival of life. It is now around 400 ppm which is very acceptable but if it drops below 180 ppm then life will be damaged. On the contrary, there is a propaganda like there is too much carbon in the air and we suffer from it.  

https://preview.redd.it/terkq4t3jkt91.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=512910d878f8b105542405e769abb6bb0ad5194b

However, when you look into the issue you can find some interesting facts. Goverments want to know how much carbon emission a citizen produces. In my country some banks are asking their customers whether they want to know their carbon emissions or not. They ask you to be a (for now) volunteer. Probably in the near future it will be a must to give that carbon emission data to them. 

So how will they collect that data? Probably you were given some carbon quota to spend. For example, when you eat/drink something in a cafe, when you buy clothes or when you have a shower etc. Every spending that a citizen makes will have some carbon amount (daily or monthly) which is decided by a goverment or a central authorithy and it will deduct from citizen's quota. If you exceed it most likely there will be a restriction, sanction or fine whatever. We still use paper money and goverments can not trace entirely where we spend our money. At that point to trace it entirely CBDC comes into play. It will be dictated to use that money and if we accept it, they will control us totally. They will exactly know where you spend your money. If that happens there is no guarantee that they will not reduce your carbon quota and force you to live in miserable conditions.

This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin should be supported. We all know it is freedom.  People should not pay the price of environmental pollution caused by big companies that we already know who they are. I

 The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 0.4 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.1 percent in August, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.2 percent before seasonal adjustment. 

 Increases in the shelter, food, and medical care indexes were the largest of many contributors to the monthly seasonally adjusted all items increase. These increases were partly offset by a 4.9-percent decline in the gasoline index. The food index continued to rise, increasing 0.8 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.7 percent. The energy index fell 2.1 percent over the month as the gasoline index declined, but the natural gas and electricity indexes increased.

 The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in September, as it did in August. The indexes for shelter, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, new vehicles, household furnishings and operations, and education were among those that increased over the month. There were some indexes that declined in September, including those for used cars and trucks, apparel, and communication. 

 The all items index increased 8.2 percent for the 12 months ending September, a slightly smaller figure than the 8.3-percent increase for the period ending August. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.6 percent over the last 12 months.

The reality is BTC can play a huge role in the way mankind transfers and holds value but its not replacing USD any time soon. I don't need to go over the properties, I've read Bitcoin Standard etc. and undeniably BTC is not going anywhere and will continue to click for people but BTC needs to coexist with other financial vehicles first. If we keep claiming it as this magic money that will replace everything else it just sets us up for failure imo. Let people believe it on their own by educating them on reasonable attributes 

Instead if ""BTC will replace USD"", I like to say it can't be debased like USD and cant be confiscated. You arent forced to use it and the people who chose to only do so because its truly a better form of money, or property really. Slowly people will realize it's trustless and deflationary nature on their own.

Instead of ""it will replace banks"" I like to say it a strong asset for diversification in a growing technical world. It's not meant to replace banks overall. It's meant to by a sly roundabout way to introduce a money that can't be controlled by any government etc. Educate them. 

I just feel like we are so defensive about it being our savior that most of the public won't take it seriously becuae they have a skeweded perception of what BTC is actually supposed to achieve.

I apologize in advance for my lack of an economics background, just trying to wrap my head around all this and feel free to correct me if I’m totally off base.


So it makes a lot of sense to say that the fed will eventually pivot, since they are tightening into a perceived recession- raising interest rates while the economy is less than fully productive and there is much economic uncertainty around the world. 

The high interest rates are crushing all asset classes and clashing with other central bank monetary policies around the world, sending their currencies into chaos.

So if that’s the case, we always say that they will eventually have to reverse course and start QE and maybe even controlling the yield curve on bonds or “something will break” / “until they break something”

So then I have a few questions:

1) is it possible that inflation will be too persistent, forcing the fed into a long-term high interest rate scenario? 

2) is this really such a binary thing, or are there more tools in the feds toolkit? 
 
Is it possible that the fed chooses a creative path towards a long, slow decline over crashing the stock market or intensifying inflation any further. Could they possibly accomplish this and orchestrate a multi-decade relatively stable/ slow decline in the value of all things against the dollar?

**Disclaimer**: Rant time. Trigger warning.

**Reason for writing this:** With the world being on the brink of the next financial recession, and several parties jumping to implement their new system,  I'm going to respond to some of my observations of the BTC community from the past 5 years or so.

# 1. Stop measuring the value of Bitcoin to fiat currency!

 Stop measuring it to fiat, be it Dollars, Euros or whatever.

If you don't, governments, with the moral support of your nan, will simply launch the new Superfedcentralbankeuropeanunionandeunitednationscoin, which will be centralized and digital. Dystopian indeed.

Bitcoin will be useless if you keep measuring it to fiat because governments and banks will still control the price and what you can buy with it. 

Also, START ACTUALLY USING Bitcoin as money. Back in my day, people praised Bitcoin for its real-world potential.

# 2. Stop making the exchanges the new central banks!

Ever heard of Binance or whichever exchange locking, losing and removing funds? That's because you don't freaking own it if it's on an account of the exchange.

Let's say that central banks and regular banks disappear tomorrow. Who will control the vast majority of Bitcoin? Centralized exchanges. Because the majority of BTC owners don't have their own wallets.

Instead, buy it privately; peer-to-peer. Which brings me to the next point.

# 3. Stop using your government ID to register your Bitcoin!

Do you have a bank account? Imagine that their ledger (your transactions) is public and everyone can analyze your behavior. That's Bitcoin.

Your ID (person, which is not a living entity) is property of the government. It says it on the card. You are at best the beneficiary as the agent. If government wants, they can take your property without consequence. 

Instead, stop registering stuff on your person and start acting privately.

Start buying and using BTC privately. Full anonymity may not be possible, but it may be good enough if you use a wallet that sends and receives from multiple addresses. There are certain cryptocurrencies that solved this problem, which I cannot mention here. 

In extension of this, think of what happened during the lockdownpandemic.

If you cannot leave your house or enter public places without some kind of digital ID, QR code, or big pharma loyalty card, it doesn't matter what currency you use. 

If you don't use cryptocurrency/Bitcoin privately, the next currency could be carbon credits for what I care. The next financial system doesn't even have to be money-based if your currency is based on your energy consumption for example.

4926,1665729887,False,"I've been buying Bitcoin via centralized exchanges and transfering directly to my hardware wallet but according to some of these CEXes it is now a requirement to make a video of MY personal wallet/holdings to prove ownership (or some bullshit) in my country before they'll let me transfer funds from my bank. To me this comes across as a poor attempt to do KYC, which I hate with a passion.

I'm new however to P2P alternatives and I have some questions that maybe some of you are willing to answer.

1. When I initiate a trade on an app like Bisq where I am the buyer my understanding is that I have to transfer funds to the seller (through various payment methods). The seller then has to confirm that the funds were received, after which a multisig transfer of Bitcoin will be initiated by Bisq.

What happens though if the seller does not confirm the arrival of my funds? Will there be any recourse for me to get my funds back, or do I simply have to trust the seller?

I know the same can be said about centralized exchanges in the sense that I have to trust them with my money (albeit temporarily) but I am wondering if maybe there is a way on the protocol level to have some sort of middleman/smart contract type functionality that still allows for fiat -&gt; crypto conversions.

2. I know nobody can answer this with 100% certainty, but how likely do you think it is that Bitcoin that was obtained outside of KYC-enabled environments will be somehow marked as such and could in the future (if/when we have mass adoption) be rejected by retailers/institutions we depend upon? (e.g. for day-to-day needs)

For example, when retailers I depend upon for my day-to-day needs accept Bitcoin through some third-party (I think this could be enforced by governments, sneak in through misinformation, etc) and this third-party would only allow for coins that have been obtained via CEXes with KYC, they would theoretically be able to reject my payment because I have obtained my coins outside of KYC enabled environments.. right?

**Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate and what it means:**

Mining power is an important security indicator for the Bitcoin (BTC) network. Hash rate represents the computing power (hash) of the network calculated by all mining rigs present in the blockchain. The higher this number, the more secure and attack-resistant the network is. Bitcoin’s hash rate showed the largest increase since May 2021, reaching 35.6 trillion hashes (+13.55%). The average mining power is 250 EH/s. Despite the ongoing bear market, BTC miners still don't care. Shortly after the news, blockchain transaction volume rose to $42.68 billion for the first time since mid-June.

The data suggests that investor activity on BTC is growing despite many significant trading volume corrections throughout the year.

30 years ago this week, on the 10th of October 1992 Hal Finney joined the Cyperpunks Mailing List. It's hard to find a person with so much love and enthusiasm for life and liberty than Hal Finney.

In his first message, Hal Finney introduced himself and suggested using public key cryptography to know you're talking to the right person online.

[Hal Finney's first message - Cypherpunks Mailing List archive - 10 Oct 92](https://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1992/10/a7deae21289e64af8c4c457307bdf1c62cbeb469f75b1613a3ed1a9dfa73b939/)

On the 15th of November 1992, Hal Finney shared his now immortal message, ""The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.""

I would urge everyone to read the entire message from this archive. Finney's foresight is unbelievable. He writes about how large organizations will be threatened and not support these ideas because a balance of power would be a net loss of power for them and that it has to be a grassroots movement ""in which individuals first learn of how much power they can have, and then demand it.""

[Cypherpunks Mailing List archive - 15 Nov 92](https://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1992/11/3d0123214e4f2b0df38cfb9fcf34ee54c8b89841b8c522c7dca561de5bf1cbee/)

The Cypherpunks Mailing List first became wildly popular after the release of ""A Cypherpunk's Manifesto"" in 1993. It is a proclamation as sacred as the Bitcoin whitepaper.

""Cypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.""

It's interesting, the narrative around governments potentially banning bitcoin could shift quite abruptly to governments trying to stockpile bitcoin in their reserves. If one world power government announces a major position in bitcoin, don't other world powers have to buy bitcoin at minimum as insurance against BTC going to $1M per coin and not having any? It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It's a tough position for governments who control fiat. Either a) ignore bitcoin, don't get to participate in the upside of bitcoin (because not owning it), but still potentially lose control of the monetary system or b) embrace bitcoin and spur the demise of fiat currency and your own control of people through money (but will own bitcoin in the new world monetary order).

Thinking through this scenario, it seems obvious there will be a major world power who breaks and buys bitcoin in size, setting of the cascade of government purchases, dooming the Fiat currency they control. **Mutual assured fiat destruction that is inevitable.**",Mutual assured fiat destruction is inevitable.,0.76

4977,1665766446,False,"TLDR ; the government finessed the people (surprise) with a huge transfer of wealth by not allowing people to possess large amounts of gold(be there own banks) and confiscating it all, then by proclamation increasing the value by roughly 75%, profiting handsomely and devaluing the dollars they exchanged to citizens for it in the process

Executive Order 6102 required all persons with more than 100$ equivalent in gold to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 (equivalent to $433 in 2021)per troy ounce. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the recently passed Emergency Banking Act of March 9, 1933, a violation of the order was punishable by fine up to $10,000 (equivalent to $209,000 in 2021),up to ten years in prison, or both.

https://imgur.com/a/8IQ4WXn

The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply during the depression. The Federal Reserve Act (1913) required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes that were issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost reached the limit of allowable credit, in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes, which could be backed by the gold in its possession.

BTW since 2020 the required reserves of cash on hand per amount deposited is zero.

https://imgur.com/a/g9PDnF8

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm

The price of gold from the Treasury for international transactions was then raised by the Gold Reserve Act to $35 an ounce (equivalent to $733 in 2021). The resulting profit that the government realized funded the Exchange Stabilization Fund, established by the 1934 Gold Reserve Act.
More about the ESF https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/206/ESF-Annual-Report-for-Fiscal-Year-2021.pdf

A New York attorney named Frederick Campbell had one deposit at Chase National Bank of over 5,000 troy ounces (160 kg) of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold, Chase refused, and Campbell sued Chase. A federal prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day (September 27, 1933) for failing to surrender his gold. Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was confiscated.

The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made gold clauses unenforceable and authorized the President to establish the gold value of the dollar by proclamation. Immediately following its passage, Roosevelt changed the statutory price of gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, thereby devaluing the US dollar, which was based on gold. That price remained in effect until August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the US would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value.",A little history lesson to emphasize the importance of self sovereignty through bitcoin.,0.89

5017,1665785187,False,"Hello, Sorry for a long question and pardon my basic question.

&amp;#x200B;

so, as I understand, when the transaction is made by a someone, it is published to the newtork and first it goes and waits in the mempool. Individual miners will pick the transactions from this mempool, combine them into a block of certain size, and does the extra work of hashing, verify transaction integrity, Merkelroot, Proof-of-Work(calculating Nonce) - include all this into a block and publish that block to the network.

&amp;#x200B;

Rest of the miners will get that block, validate the transaction correctness, nonce and all that stuff, and give a consensus. If a consensus is reached, then the block is added to the blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

Given all this background, i have questions on who does what

&amp;#x200B;

1. Where is the mempool? is that in some central or a group of nodes (and uses somekind of DHT with Chord kind of search protocol) or is that a module within Bitcoin core software that every node has? In other words, does every node in the bitcoin network has a mempool where every unconfirmed transaction of the entire world are saved?

&amp;#x200B;

I think the full blockchain is around 250GB now, so on top of it, every node also has this mempool of some GBs?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Take three miners A, B, C from millions of miner nodes in the network. And assume mempool has 10,000 transactions, and assume each block will contain some 3000 transactions. So can each of these miners take 3000 transactions randomly from the pool and form a block with those? Which means a particular transaction can be in the blocks of A &amp; B, and not C?

&amp;#x200B;

3. Now, based on #2 assumption, suppose each block is busy in 'guessing' the nonce. Assume miner B has figured out the nonce for the block it created with its picked up transactions. It will publish to the network.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, will miners A &amp; C stop doing their own nonce calculations, and start verifying the block published by B? Or will they continue doing their calculations until a new block is added and paralelly spool another thread for verification? If miners are not the ones validating the block of B, then who's doing that?

&amp;#x200B;

4. Assume nodes A, C has validated, and everything is ok. How do they communicate back to B that they are ok? And when exactly will B add the block to the blockchain? after how many approvals? If B is not the one adding to the blockchain, then who's adding it to the blockchain and publishing to the updated chain to the network again?

5. And finally, is it that the nodes that does the transactions, and nodes that mine the blocks are different? Meaning transactions are normal nodes like us whoever installs the bitcoin software in their laptop and receive/send bitcoin, and miners are specialized computers whose sole purpose is to mine and earn and they don't transact as normal people?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

-----------
SINGLE SIG RECOVERY CHECK
Perform recovery phrase check on your hardware wallet with your seed phrase in hand.

“The big scary”: On purpose enter your PIN incorrectly three or sixteen times to reset your hardware wallet.

Disconnect, then reconnect your hardware wallet to your wallet software to verify it recognizes it as a “brand new” device with zero balance.

Re-enter your seed phrase into your hardware wallet, and verify the wallet software now confirms the same satoshi balance of your UTXOs.

*Note: It is recommended after confirming this process works to not utilize the recovered wallet as your main wallet.

5149,1665897961,False,"These days, discussions on CBDC are rising again. When you forget, you will hear it once in a while. The bottom line is that it will be forgotten again. Then it will raise the issue again. It is expected that such repetition will be made several times in the future.

The debate on CBDC is simple. It is a matter of whether the state directly conducts banking or lets commercial banks do as they do now. No more, no less. However, even if CBDC is introduced, it is impossible to eliminate all existing banks, so it will inevitably take on the appearance of the state and banks jointly conducting banking. It is meaningless. Because it is nothing more than an additional bank. Nor is there a new innovation in particular.

Nevertheless, the reason why CBDC is on the stage of discussion is none other than China. In other words, the essence of this issue is actually only in the struggle for key currencies between countries. From the perspective of the general private sector, the emergence of another bank called the state has no significance. On the other hand, the U.S. will have to tilt its head when watching China. It gets into an ambiguous position.

China is going wild to take away the hegemony of the U.S. key currency. Having done business in China for a while, I am well aware of the structural habits of China's political economy. Huawei's backdoor is China's true face. Huawei's Ren Zhengfei would have personally opposed it desperately. 

The Chinese enjoy a kind of voyeurism. It's not a clever thing but they don't feel the shame. Rather, they feel orgasm. There is still a culture in China that the man who using shallow tricks is a smart guy. They think of a bone head as a smart head. As a result, China was humiliated from all over the world because of the backdoor. The whole story of the case is as follows. Ninety-nine percent of what happens in China is like that.

An official of the Chinese Communist Party came up with a trick and forced Ren Zhengfei to do backdoor, and Ren Zhengfei had no choice but to follow the instructions. If he refuses, he'll be shot immediately or at least in prison. China is such a place. Ren Zhengfei is just a pitiful person. This is China. This is one of the most important things to pay attention to during Xi Jinping's future reign. He should be able to accept a deep head, not a shallow head. The reason why China is now branded as a shameful country from the world is that it used shallow heads, not deep heads. Now it has to be changed. It is the only way for China to regain its dignity as a great country.

The idea of creating a key currency with CBDC is a low-level idea. It is an idea with an IQ of about 80 to 90, and its level is similar to that of a backdoor. By the way, China is trying to take down the dollar hegemony with an idea that doesn't make any sense. Therefore, even if the U.S. does not step up specifically, China's attempt will go to nothing. The reason is as follows.

First of all, CBDC cannot erase the impression that it is being led by people who do not have professional knowledge about cryptocurrency, especially programming knowledge. This is the same in South Korea. Even South Korea's former chairman of the Financial Services Commission was a person who mistook the NFT for currency. As a result, if Picasso creates and sells 100 NFTs, he must go to prison for violating the law. This is the positive law still in use in Korea. (In addition to the securities law, there is a separate prohibition law in South Korea. Americans would never have imagined.)

CBDC is issued by the central bank of the country and is issued in the currency unit of the country. Namely, it is issued in yuan in China and in dollars in the United States. Therefore, in the United States, even in Korea, Japan, and even Taiwan, you cannot buy Coca-Cola at convenience stores with the yuan CBDC. Anyhow currency exchange is required.

If they can purchase goods directly with the yuan CBDC without needing currency exchange, their idea will be deep thinking, not a shallow trick. But China's CBDC framers have no idea about it. There is no idea of a new yuan that can be used around the world without currency exchange. In other words, there is no idea to impart global characteristics to CBDC in itself, like gold or Bitcoin. There is nothing more or less than just one new Chinese giant commercial bank.

The bank can only exert its power only inside China, and outside China, it will be treated as no different from conventional Chinese commercial banks. Already, most commercial banks around the world have long introduced overseas credit cards that can convert their own currency into currency units in other countries in real-time. The same is true of commercial banks in China. Therefore, the idea that China launches the CBDC to break down the dollar hegemony is no different from the idea that the Chinese Communist Party supports one existing Chinese commercial bank to issue unlimited yuan currency. The CBDC of the Central Bank of China is nothing more and nothing less. Nothing is new but rather infringes on personal information and privacy.

Even if CBDC is operated based on the form of a blockchain, this is only a formality. It is because the state won't substantially hand over the operation rights of P2P nodes to the general public. In other words, in CBDC, the blockchain is nothing more than fiction. In this case, the node operator is only a national official. Therefore, it is no different from having a single centralized server in the first place, and rather, it is efficient to do so. In short, CBDC is not a P2P. Even if a CBDC transfer is made between individuals, it is completely the same as an account transfer within a central bank account. For it is the same as transferring between accounts within the same single commercial bank. Therefore, CBDC is a server-client system, not a P2P. In conclusion, even if CBDC takes the form of a blockchain, it is not a blockchain. The node held by an individual is nothing more than a backup of a central server.

This was also the reason why the United States initially considered CBDC unnecessary. CBDC doesn't have any particular groundbreaking factors. The U.S. dollar hegemony is the only achievement of U.S. national power and U.S. commercial banks. In order to establish yuan hegemony, China also has no choice but to strengthen its national power beyond the U.S., and China's commercial banks should expand around the world to play an active role. Launching a bank that issues CBDCs can't change anything.

I do not know in detail why CBDC is studied in countries other than China. In the case of South Korea, there is a local currency issued by each local government. If this is done at the national level, it becomes a CBDC. However, the purpose of each local government in Korea issuing local currency is completely different from the concept of CBDC. The purpose is only to ensure that the low-income class consumes properly. In other words, local currency can be used mainly only for the consumption of daily necessities and cannot be used outside the local government. As such, Korea's local currency has an opposite direction from CBDC. In other words, it is not aimed at expanding nationwide but rather at limited use within the region.

The CBDC discussion in Korea is also pathetic. Research is being conducted without knowing why CBDC should be studied. Among them, the most likely reason is that other countries are doing research, so Korea should follow them. There is no other compelling reason. Since others are running, they just run along with them.

But that's what the U.S. looks like now. Since China is running, the U.S. is also running. But, as seen above, China's CBDC idea is nothing more than a shallow level. Just as One Belt, One Road fell into a shallow level and became the subject of international resentment, their yuan CBDC cannot escape the shallow level. Although it is basically an incompetent idea, it is indeed laughable for the U.S. to run along with it. If the U.S. wants to run after China, it should first examine what brilliant and admittable process China's yuan CBDC can go through to become a key currency. The U.S. is just running along with China, not arguing about this and that, surprised by China's run. If China was wise, it should follow suit, but if they were stupid, it should not follow suit. However, the current U.S. does not seem to have such a judging ability. There is no real professional in sight.",The Truth About CBDC,0.78

5154,1665906919,False,"Edit: yes it is. But what about stagnation? 

There was the gold standard. But it seemed to only work during good times and was always ditched during big crisis like wars or recessions. 

There was already an ugly mechanism where panic was used to steal gold from people while devaluing it, then revalue it and sell it back to them while devaluing paper. 

But that was not good enough for the US, so they took advantage of their role in WW2 to setup the Brenton Woods system. USD became the reserve currency of the world, backed by gold. 

Eventually US reached stagflation, as put in evidence by decades of sideways movement. The USD being so international was putting the US in an uneasy economic situation where long term growth of stock seemed impossible. 

First they adjusted the price of gold, quietly, but once people caught on to it they just said “fuck it. I have a new toy”. The new USD was born, backed by a promise and a smile. 

Maybe, when looking at indexes, stagflation is the healthy balance? Some companies flourish, some tank, but on the whole the value does not increase much, unless the country performs well with net balance of exports of goods and services.

A Bitcoin standard would ensure that a country reaches ~~stagflation~~  stagnation if it remains export/import balanced. 
Inflation would occur if it imports too much. 
Deflation if it produces more than what it needs.

Does not stagflation mean, energy, rent, food, goods, everything would always cost the same? Is that bad?

So, inflation is the only unwanted outcome of the three. Yet, it is the only outcome guaranteed by the FIAT standard.

It is not about the price of Bitcoin. It is about how many people think in Bitcoin.",Is Stagflation a bad thing?,0.57

*As I always do, this is my update of the stats here in Venezuela (Venezuelan living here).*

*Nothing excitng this week, 1 BTC less than last week. So monthly average is around 120 BTC.*

*These stats are only for LocalBitcoin (because they make them public), other exchanges are Binance, Airtm and Reserve. Binance is king with P2P even with Bolivares!*

*One BTC trades at 167,000 Bs. (Bolivares), remember that since 2007, 14 zeroes have been removed from the currency by law.*

*Monthly minimum wage still under 16 USD and average around 100 USD.*

*Crypto has been used for years so people would exchange their Bolivares as soon as possible! Some people use them to send remittances to their families here and also people mining (house electricity is free, here mining with GPU is still profitable hahaha).*

Opendime is a USB stick described as a disposable hardware wallet and is compatible with any computer, laptop, and phone. A third-party wallet is still required to move funds in and out of Opendime and users can import the private key into any bitcoin wallet to start spending.

A key part of the Opendime security model is that it acts like a piggy bank as it requires to be destroyed to spend the funds. There is no password or seed phrase, only a private key is generated within the device at the time of setup.

When the USB is plugged into a device, it will generate a QR Code and text files along with your bitcoin address. Using the QR Code you can check your balance, payment address and once unsealed, your private key.

It can be unsealed using a Push Pin at any time to reveal a private key and to start spending your Bitcoin online.

The article explores how megapolitical factors drive institutional changes and how the digital economy and money are likely to shape the future.

The full article is [here](https://4galt.com/the-shifting-logic-of-violence/).  I posted the beginning of the article below to help you decide if you are interested.

  

**Violence - The Key Social Variable** *“The key to understanding how societies evolve is to understand the factors that determine the costs and rewards of employing violence.”* The Sovereign Individual

“The Sovereign Individual” by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg originally written in 1997, provides equal parts history and prophecy. The authors predicted a number of social, political and technological developments currently unfolding based upon a thorough historical analysis of what they call the logic of violence **(LV).** The book argues that controlling violence (ie. Protecting life and property) is the key social variable and that each society forms a logic of violence based upon two factors:

1. The returns or profitability of violence,
2. The optimal scale of violence (large vs. small)

“The Sovereign Individual” explores how historical shifts in megapolitical factors (topography, climate, technology, and microbes) drive changes in the LV.  Finally, when the LV shifts, almost everything (institutions, morality, economics) in society adapts to the new logic.

The book argues that history has seen at least three transition periods in the logic of violence; and that the world currently is transitioning from an industrial economy to an information economy. This article highlights two previous transitions examined in the book, namely, dark ages to feudalism and feudalism to the industrial period. Our aim is to use the historical transitions to understand the Sovereign Individual model and then apply the model to the current transition in the LV.",The Megapolitics of Information Economics,0.62

# What is Going On?

​Last year, the crypto world was shaken to its core when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), acting in behalf of the G20, released their guidance on virtual assets.1)

This document laid out a set of rules regarding stablecoins, distinctions between private and hosted wallets, extensive KYC requirements, the tackling of privacy tools, and more.2) FATF has also provided a final definition of the type of service provider tasked with reporting on crypto: the Virtual Asset Service Provider, or **VASP**.

Fast forward to today, and these rules are quickly being implemented across the world.3) But as usual, it didn’t stop there. Another international regulator, the OECD, is already building on this framework in an attempt to massively increase the grip of authorities on what happens in the industry. ​

# What is the OECD?

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is a Paris-based international organisation that works to “build better policies for better lives.” Its goal is to shape policies that foster prosperity, equality, opportunity and well-being for all.4)

Together with governments, policy makers and citizens, the OECD works on finding solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. From improving economic performance and creating jobs, to fostering strong education and fighting international tax evasion. The organisation provides a unique forum and knowledge hub within which to discuss and develop public policies and international standard setting.5)

This “international standard” setting is what we will look at next.

# Automated Exchange of Financial Information with Authorities Since 2014

In 2014, the OECD published the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters.6) This publication created a “Common Reporting Standard” (**CRS**), which forces financial institutions to automatically exchange account information with the authorities of the country of residence of their account holders. The goal: to prevent persons from holding financial accounts in offshore jurisdictions and not reporting them back home.

This is why all financial service providers request utility bills: they prove where you live, and hence where they have to report to.

**All financial institutions** that are currently subjected to these regulations are forced to **automatically report** to the authorities the name, address, Tax Identification Number(s), date and place of birth, the account number, and **the account value** as of the end of the relevant calendar year (or other appropriate reporting period).7)

Now, there is no more hiding of accounts held with a foreign financial institutions. The authorities enlisted all financial institutions as involuntary (but powerful) assistants in collecting facts and evidence needed for tax compliance.

# The Panama Papers; Just in Time to Boost Worldwide Implementation of Automated Reporting…

After publishing their standards in 2014, the OECD needed to get countries and their financial institutions in line. By August 2015, the OECD had released the first version of a CRS Implementation Handbook.8) It provided practical guidance to assist government officials and financial institutions in implementing CRS.

But while the standards set by the OECD came into force in 2016 in early-adopting states, by March of 2016 these standards were still far from being fully integrated into the global financial system.9) This was especially true in the offshore jurisdictions that were the main target.

What was needed was a shift in conscience…

On April 3rd, 2016, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a giant leak of offshore financial records, better known as the Panama Papers.10) These revelations caused public outrage.

The G5, the five largest Western European countries, were quick to jump on the bandwagon and call for more international cooperation to tackle “tax dodging and illicit finance.”11) The message did not fall on deaf ears; the next day, on April 15th, G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors met in Washington and issued the following Communiqué:

*“…we call on all relevant countries including* ***all financial centers and jurisdictions***\*, which have not committed to implement the standard on\* ***automatic exchange of information by 2017 or 2018*** *to do so without delay and to sign the Multilateral Convention. We expect that by the 2017 G20 Summit all countries and jurisdictions will upgrade their Global Forum rating to a satisfactory level. We mandate the OECD working with G20 countries to establish objective criteria by our July meeting to identify non-cooperative jurisdictions with respect to tax transparency.* ***Defensive measures*** *will be considered by G20 members* ***against non-cooperative jurisdictions*** *if progress as assessed by the Global Forum is not made.”12)*

Thus, within 12 days of the publication of the Panama Papers, the world’s 20 most powerful governments had collectively agreed to start pushing CRS reporting requirements aggressively, and to punish non-cooperative (offshore) jurisdictions—regardless of their local laws.

This is how offshore finance was brought into the fold, and financial privacy died.

# Why Can the OECD Regulate Financial Institutions Around the World? Isn’t this a Task of Democracy?

The OECD isn’t a government agency of any individual country. As such, it cannot create law. It issues what is known as “soft laws,” or “recommendations” and “guidance.” Only when this guidance is transposed into the laws of individual countries does it becomes “hard” law, with real world power.

In theory, this process is subjected to the formal (democratic) law-making processes of the implementing countries. However, countries that don’t participate face restricted access to the financial system and ostracism from the international community. For this reason, almost all nations are compelled to implement these recommendations.

It must also be said that national governments, especially in the Western world, highly value this kind of international cooperation, and the control it gives them without the need to deal with the “inconveniences” of democracy. They simply hide behind the fact that these are “international standards” which they have to follow because “everybody” does.

Neither does it help that few of our representatives, journalists and fellow citizens seem to understand the impact of these treaties. Those in the legal industry who do understand the implications just look at it as “business as usual” and a new way to generate income. As such, most standards are passed into domestic law with little opposition or delay.

# International Standards Aim to Supersede National Law

Once these treaties are accepted, they become part of a body of law called “international law,” which in many cases supersedes national laws. Unknown to the general public, international law is increasingly being used as a backdoor for passing invasive regulations such as those we are discussing here, and establishing a global bureaucracy with real power over our (financial) lives.

It is also worth noting that the people working for this Paris-based institution have not been elected, their procedures and budget are not subjected to democratic oversight, and they are almost impossible to remove from power.

Like most international organizations, their operations fall under the Vienna Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities.13) As such, they enjoy immunity for their actions taken whilst in office, are exempt from administrative burdens (such as taxes and fines), and enjoy less stringent (COVID) travel restrictions.

# AUTOMATIC Exchange of Transaction Info For Crypto

Last week, October 10th, the OECD published the “Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and Amendments to the Common Reporting Standard.”14)

This applies the tax reporting guidance of the existing CRS to crypto―and makes it FAR more invasive…

The OECD first published a public consultation version of the document on 22nd March 2022.15) The deadline for feedback from the public was 29th April 2022. This gave the public just over a month to analyze a 101-page document, figure out what it meant for them and their clients in multiple jurisdictions, and formulate a public statement on company letterhead.

This is not a sign that the OECD takes public input seriously. When comparing the two documents, there is no material difference between the public consultation and the final version in the section that matters most, the actual rules…16)

Public consultations give these recommendations the appearance of being widely supported by “stakeholders.” It creates the illusion that the public has a say in the matter. It doesn’t. When you read the questions carefully, they only seek feedback on details, such as which intermediaries are to be included or excluded, which type of NFTs are to be in scope, what reporting thresholds there should be, and how much time should be reserved for implementation.17)

Furthermore, if you read the commentaries submitted, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/public-comments-received-on-the-crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm), most respondents just talk their own book, trying to elicit amendments that perhaps exempt them from a specific reporting requirement, or trying to get a longer time-frame for implementation. In all fairness, there were also a number of industry insiders who highlighted the double standards created for the crypto industry, and how much of a burden the regulations would represent. In the end, none of this mattered. The regulations have been published and are now the new worldwide standard.

# What Are The New Guidelines for Crypto?

​ As was the case with earlier regulations, Bitcoin will not be banned. Instead, the OECD builds on the approach set by FATF: to regulate the service providers who facilitate transactions.

In this instance, the OECD developed a new global tax transparency framework which provides for the automatic exchange of tax info on transactions in a standardised manner. This is the **“Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework”** or “**CARF.**”18)

As previously mentioned, automatic exchange of information used to contain only the details of the individual and the account value. New reporting obligations, however, apply to all transactions in an account. This is a major extension of the reporting obligations that currently exist for non-crypto financial services.

# Reporting of Transactions (and their Nature) by VASPS

The OECD proposes that those providing crypto transaction services, for or on behalf of customers, are to report under the CARF. We are talking here about the reporting entities that are defined by FATF, i.e. “Virtual Asset Service Providers,” or “VASPs.”19)

&amp;#x200B;

**Before we look at the details of the information that is going to be exchanged, let us remind ourselves of what a VASP is:**

*“VASP: Virtual asset service provider means* ***any natural or legal person*** *who is not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations, and as a business* ***conducts one or more of the following activities*** *or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person:*

*i. exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies;ii. exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets;iii. transfer of virtual assets;iv. safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets; andv. participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.”20)*

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, the definition of VASP is so wide that it covers many of projects currently operating in the crypto space. According to the OECD, reporting obligations also apply to companies facilitating Decentralized Finance and Decentralized Exchanges.21)

&amp;#x200B;

# What Kind of Individual Transactions Are to Be Reported?

What needs to be reported? In particular, the following three types of transactions:

&amp;#x200B;

* Exchanges between Crypto Assets and Fiat Currencies;
* Exchanges between one or more form(s) of Crypto Assets;
* Transfers of Crypto Assets (including Reportable Retail Payment Transactions).22)

&amp;#x200B;

Transactions will be reported by type of Crypto Asset, and will distinguish between outward and inward transactions. In order to enhance the usability of the data for tax administrations, the reporting is to be split out between Crypto-to-Crypto and Crypto Asset-to-fiat transactions. Reporting service providers will also be forced to label transfers (e.g. airdrops, income derived from staking or a loan), in instances where they have such knowledge.23)

In short, the CARF mandates that information an all trades, including the type of coin, the amount of coins, the market value, and what was paid, be submitted. This info is then aggregated and automatically exchanged.24) The goal is to inform the tax authorities of how much you own and what kind of income you generated from your holdings.

And if that is not enough, the OECD allows lawmakers the option to request lists of private wallet addresses of users.25)

# Reporting of Retail Transactions from Private Wallets

On a final note, the OECD has come up with a trick to limit the opportunity for crypto users to spend their coins anonymously. The CARF also applies to merchant providers facilitating crypto payment for goods or services. In such instances, the merchant provider is required to treat the customer of their customer as its own customer, and report the value of the transaction to the tax authorities of the buyer.26)

For now, this only applies to “large” purchases of over USD 50,000.\[27\]

&amp;#x200B;

# What About US Citizens and Green-Card Holders?

The CRS has been implemented worldwide. All developed nations and all international financial centers have been included in the list, leaving few of the world’s financial highways untouched.28)

Surprisingly, the United States is not on that list. The reason is that the US came up with their own automatic reporting framework even before the OECD did. It is called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, and requires that foreign financial Institutions and certain other non-financial foreign entities report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders.29)

Up until now, FATCA did not directly apply to crypto. But the new 2023 budget proposal seeks to amend section 6038D(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to require reporting for a new third category, namely any account that holds digital assets maintained by a foreign digital asset exchange or other foreign digital asset service provider (a “foreign digital asset account”).30)

There is also another US-specific reporting obligation, the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. Regarding FBAR, FinCEN has issued Notice 2020-2, stating that it also intends to make reporting foreign virtual currency accounts mandatory.31) Moreover, US tax payers are already required to report their crypto transactions on their tax returns.32)

The question is, will the United States also implement a CARF like system, as in the automatic reporting of all transactions? This question remains unanswered for now. But President Biden’s Executive Order from earlier this year clearly stated that the current administration is committed to these international standards, including those commissioned by the G20 and FATF, and that the US has a leading role in developing and adopting these international standards on digital assets.33)

Despite all this, it is still unclear what the regulatory landscape in the US will look like. Regardless, US-based companies with clients in other countries (i.e. most of them) will have to implement these policies. It is hard to imagine the US government not wanting to have this information for itself, especially since the legal framework is largely in place. But we will have to wait and see.

# What Will Be the Outcome of These Regulations?

​The outcome of these new international standards will be **full transparency towards tax authorities**. The aim of these standards is to get automatic insight into all your trades, even laying the foundation to prevent you from spending coins anonymously with retailers that use a third party payment provider.

This means in practice that although you can hold coins in your private wallet, you cannot easily spend or exchange them anonymously. In short: no more privacy when you use third party services.

One might say this will be the death of third party services, because accepting online payments is as simple as installing a piece of code on your website and taking the payments yourself. But most companies do not have the capacity to run their own payment system, and are likely going to require payments through a regulated merchant.

As long as there isn’t a Bitcoin standard, meaning accounting and payments regularly done in Bitcoin, there will be a need for fiat on- and off ramps. As such, even when you do business in crypto, your suppliers or clients are likely to make use of a service provider with reporting obligations.

As a result, expect far more scrutiny on transactions; from exchanges, but also from the people and businesses you are dealing with in everyday crypto activity. Even if you do not need to report on certain transactions, they might be forced to do so.

You might be okay with accepting direct peer-to-peer transactions, but could run into issues later when you are obliged to prove where the payments came from.

# Regulators Are Out of Control

The reality is that these regulators are out of our control. Without (direct) democratic mandates or oversight they are flooding the world with regulation. Just like totalitarian regimes, they effectively force private parties to police each other.

The service providers, forced into unpaid financial surveillance, carry the rising compliance costs. Obliged to make hard decisions as to whom they can take on as customers, they are likely to cut services to those they consider not worth the compliance costs, such as small or “high risk” businesses, and people in developing nations.

The cost of compliance might become so great that at least some of them might want to facilitate transactions only with fully-vetted wallets tied to a digital ID, such as the EU is implementing.34)

# New Precedent: Centralized Surveillance of Individual Transactions

This is a good example of regulations being built on top of one another, and raising the bar with each step. It should not come as a surprise if at some point regular financial service providers are forced into similar obligations to get in line with these new “international standards.” This step might be taken with the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies, currently being developed all around the world.35)

# Door Open to Further Monitoring and Restricting of Payments

It is not hard to imagine that once all transactions are transparent, more actions can be taken as to which type of payments and type of persons are allowed or not. We can see this financial “cancel culture” already happening around the world.36)

As a result of all this surveillance, it is not only privacy that is at risk right now; this starts to touch the very idea of maintaining a payment system where you can freely transact and engage in economic activity.

Only a massive and radical decentralization movement away from third party service providers can prevent this dystopia. Stay tuned for a next report and a roadmap for just that…

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR;

**Governments at the highest level (G20) commissioned an organization called the OECD to come up with international tax transparency rules for crypto. They are using international law frameworks that supersede national legislation and will demand that every country in the world complies.**

**The OECD issued their guidance last week, Oct 10, 2022. They propose that Virtual Asset Service Providers are to be required to annually report, on your trades and transactions, to the tax authorities of your country of residence.**

**Reporting on transaction information is a major extension of reporting obligations as they exist for regular financial institutions. The US is also looking to expand its own reporting frameworks.**

Was looking at buying a mining setup, which would be approx 160Th/s x 8 or 10 (Pending on what I decide to get)

I was wondering if this was something that would be viable long term for solo mining, or if i would need to join a group.

Ive been reading up and see a new block chain every 10 minutes, worht 6.25 coins etc. I understand you can win a chain and get it all solo. However, what happens if you don't win it (Which would be more the case) do you earn partial coins as a reward for the chain?

Im super new and confused as calculators I see online how something like 0.001 coin per day etc. It's that just an overall and you get nothing until you earn a block..? Im not sure how it works and no one I know is into mining.

After all, why not try selling at the top, then buying back after a correction? Why not do this over and over again to make more and more money?

This approach comes with several problems:

* Why sell something you think has a positive long-term future to prepare for a decline you think is temporary?
* By doing so, you introduce the additional risk of being wrong (when there are already so many), since the decline may not happen.
* Selling to try to time the market gives you two ways to be wrong: the decline may not happen, and if it does, you'll still have to decide when to buy back in. Not easy.
* You may even have a third way to go wrong. Once you sell your asset, what are you going to do with the money until the dip happens and you consider it time to get back into the market?
* Sellers who have been right always having a hard time choosing the right time to re-enter the market, which can cause them to wait until lower and never take a position again.
* Finally, how will you handle the case where you are wrong and there is no dip? Will you be able to accept this psychologically by overcoming your regrets and taking higher positions?

It is therefore generally not a good idea to sell in an attempt to time the market. Opportunities to do so are rare, and very few people have the skills to take advantage of these opportunities.

It is not in your best interest to get into a game where you are up against traders who are much more skilled than you are.

I'd personally say that a bullrun could happen at any other point and that the ""cycles"" aren't as reliable since the analyzed timeframe is too small.

I'm a young Bitcoiner who's been in the space since 2019-ish, and I've recently decided to jump in and launch something of my own. I've been thinking a lot lately about how I can provide value to the Bitcoin community, rather than it being vice versa. I'm currently a university student, and although I can't code and do not come from a technical background, I do have a passion for writing.

I've decided to launch a newsletter called BitNews. It's not an insanely technical or in-depth newsletter, but rather, a simple one which is aimed at providing people with an easy way to stay up-to-date on the Bitcoin space. I send editions out every Sunday/Monday, and they contain a couple of the top BTC headlines from the past week. It's simple, and it may be a dumb idea (who knows), but I know that we all have busy weeks from time to time and it can be hard to stay as caught up on the Bitcoin space as we'd like to be. It's completely free, and the newsletter contains zero filler aside from a short intro and 2 short spotlight segments that I write. 

If any of you awesome humans are interested, you can subscribe here: [bitnews.substack.com](https://bitnews.substack.com)

I decided to post this on here just because the newsletter is brand new and has 0 subscribers as of right now, and although I'm not expecting hundreds of subscribers, it would be neat to have a few of you on the other side to write these newsletters for. Bitcoin has changed my life in more ways than one, and a large part of that has to due with our awesome community.

Does anyone know of an online marketplace where goods/services can be listed for sale and traded *peer-to-peer* for bitcoin ***legally***? Ideally, buyers and sellers could/should remain anonymous, with ratings/reviews serving as the basis of merchant trust (customer trust being unnecessary as we're talking about bitcoin payments only). The service that matches buyer and seller receives a (very) small fee, sort of like Amazon, Craigslist, etc (other than the taking a very small cut part). Private parties would be responsible for paying applicable taxes on any profits made just like a flea market, etc. 

I find it weird that I don't know of such a website/service yet and the whole concept seems like a major gap that needs to be filled. Are there legal ramifications I'm not considering that are preventing such a thing? I ask, because this would be the only way I would ever be willing to part with my bitcoin (and even then, I'd just buy more with fiat to replace it) and something that I would really like to see happen someday to cut out all the greedy middle men polluting the current system.

5500,1666124099,False,"I don't get it. Let's say a cup of coffee is $3. That's 15675 sats today. What difference to your future wealth potential does it make if you pay with sats or dollars?

If you pay with sats, you have less BTC and will miss out on the gains from its future appreciation.

But if you pay with dollars, you have $3 less to invest in BTC and benefit from its future appreciation. If spending BTC on coffee is stupid, so is spending dollars on coffee, because every dollar spent on coffee is a dollar not invested in BTC.

A more interesting argument to make would be: in a world where Bitcoin exists, why would anyone buy a cup of coffee and NOT invest the same amount in BTC?

The short answer: the existence of a store of value like Bitcoin can lower people's time preference and make them consume less. Still, they will continue to buy coffee, because, well, they like coffee.

That, however, has nothing to do with the form of payment used. If you've already decided to cough up $3 on a cup coffee, you can as well pay with BTC, which as a payment rail has many advantages.","Why is the argument often brought up that people will not want to pay for coffee with BTC, because they expect its price to appreciate?",0.85

Now that sell off may have triggered some fear as the price dipped, but this makes me believe that it could come back really strong and really fast as the global economy stabilizes. Especially when combined with the massive inflation of the dollar.

* Bitcoin has seen a 41% increase in energy consumption Year-on-Year (YoY) despite dramatic improvements in energy efficiency and a more diverse and sustainable energy mix.
* There are concerns the rise could see regulators clamp down on mining. 
* The data comes from a Q3 2022 report by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) which represents 51 of the world's largest Bitcoin mining companies.
* Bitcoin mining also emitted 0.10% of the world’s carbon emissions which the BMC deemed to be “negligible.”
* The increase in Bitcoin energy consumption comes as the network’s hashrate increased 8.34% in Q3 2022 and 73% YoY, despite fewer blocks being produced and downward price pressure.

Since yesterday someone constantly adds huge transactions to the mempool that aggregate bitcoins from hundreds (up to 1000) almost identical UTXOs into one, not even using Segwit, just plain old legacy addresses... I was hoping to open some more Lightning channels for 1sat/vB, but the mempool is being filled by something that looks to me like a huge mixing operation...

[https://mempool.space/tx/36d5eb08110aa6dd73d09a831f279b423a17a9be0d552cebac7dc7003c6e82c5](https://mempool.space/tx/36d5eb08110aa6dd73d09a831f279b423a17a9be0d552cebac7dc7003c6e82c5)

There are also these transactions that aggregate 300-500 of 2 of 3 UTXOs with absolutely identical, very small, balance.

[https://mempool.space/tx/9f684469c85350d35e6c4641f4960aa23c1004b1fc1a999761bd57af7308bfb8](https://mempool.space/tx/9f684469c85350d35e6c4641f4960aa23c1004b1fc1a999761bd57af7308bfb8)

The addresses are generally very old... They were in use since the beginning of 2018... Since then, each of the addresses has been used in hundreds or even thousands of many-in-many-out transactions...

And just like yesterday the rate at which new transactions are added to the mempool seems to be artificially held at a ""balanced"" 1600vB/s...

It seems like everything you buy in Turkey is 80% off due to this one simple trick of putting it on a credit card and waiting for inflation to do its thing. Also the turkish government wants to **lower** interest rates. Meaning as inflations grows worse the discount will get even better.

How secure is the network ? Can we be sure that in the future it still will be.

Why alt coins are absolutely no way near the level of what bitcoin is.

Maybe a new contender in the future.

Let me put the setting down. I'm 25 M. Lives in central Ohio.  Huge nerd when it comes to anything technology based. I have a family of 2 kids and one loving fiancee. 

So. It's July. Money's running tight. I can no longer be a stay at home dad so I get a job working at a hotel chain.  My job was to fold towels and get the House keeping carts stocked for the next day. Super lame. Didn't pay much it and was 3rd shift so I never was able to see my family. Few months go by. One night I take a poop and sit down open reddit like we all do. I start scrolling.  10 mins go by. I'm about done and I see this post on r/Bitcoinmining ""now hiring in FWD area."" (Fort worth Dallas I had to Google it). They where in need of some one to work on machines and help get caught up on tickets.  It's 16 hours from my house. For shits and giggle not expecting it to actually hit.i out my self out there.  

""Mining since 2012, fixing machines since 2015 managed my own mine with over 150 machines. I'm willing to make the drive to work this job."" I press send and continue about my shift and forgot I even sent it. 

I get home about 8am and a message comes into my DMs something along the lines ""hey I'm Chris. Owner of Mining Syndicate."" We chat for a bit.  I tell him I would walk out of my job right now if I had the gas money to get down there right now and prove my self. The world stopped for a moment in my life with the next reply being ""what's your Venmo?"" 

I gave him the information and he sends me 200$ with the reply. See you soon.  I kinda lost it for a bit. I called my mom my grandma my GF was extremely excited I called my discord friends screaming. I was so excited and seriously couldn't contain my self. Now. I will make a note. Almost everyone I knew was telling me, they are gonna harvest your organs or kidnap you. I said good point. Let me roll on it.  (When I can't decide something I roll a D20) 

Well my dice hate me so I rolled 3 of them.  

If it's high. I go.  

If it's low. I return the money and keep the hotel job. 

17, 9, 19

I sat there with a smile on my face for like 10 mins looking at these dice.  Son of a bitch. I'm going. I called my boss. I said I unfortunately can't continue working here. I grabbed my Gaming PC my GF packed my suitcase. And left that next morning. 

1 stop at an old friends house in AR and I was in Texas at 7am the next morning. 2 hours of sleep in the car. I roll up and get out of the car. I walk in the building and I'm nervous. I left my firearm in the car. Am I going to get my kidney yoinked? Then Chris walks out from his office and he introduces himself. Boom. Kidneys secure.  

A few hours pass by we are interviewing. Getting into buckets of information left and right. Very unconventional compared to other companies interviewing. But I dig it. 

I'm now in my 3 day trial. I start fixing machines left and right getting stuff on track. I'm feeling the old energy pumping things are clicking. Time passes


6 hours into my trial. I am hired on the spot. I'm flabbergasted. I seriously tried so hard not to tear up. The job of a life time is now mine. We discuss pay the next day. I won't get into actual dollar amounts. But he immediately offers paid travel, an onsite RV, wear and tear on the car and a bit more from what I was making at the hotel. I have been working here for now 2-3 months and every day is a joy to get out of bed. I absolutely love this job and this company.  

My first week I got my first compliment from a big client. I was stunned. ""nice hire Chris"" 

So. It's 3 weeks in Dallas. And 1 week home with the family. Both ways paid for.  Is that hard. Yes. I miss my family terribly. But they understand this is the job I have been waiting for and I can't thank them enough for letting me do it.

You need to find a place secure enough that no one else has access to it in the short and long term, at the same time you must not forget, and it has to be protected from accidents (fire, water, etc) and duplicated in another location that fulfills these same requirements.

This is not so easy if you take in consideration that people may have cleaning staff, visits, reform, painters, and also you may move several times, you may have a couple and break with them and have another couple, and you need to have control of the alternative place to store the key words too...yo may need to change the storage location and you have to think of it from time to time in order to not forget the place where you leave it.

5784,1666292778,False,"I recently had a back-and-forty with some Ethereans about the Bitcoin Security Budget. Their claim was that Bitcoin’s network is getting less secure because block reward is decreasing and transaction fees are low. 

I said that claim was not empirical because it ignored the fact that hashrate is going up, and as hashrate goes up, Bitcoin gets more secure. 

They basically said, “Nope, hashrate also goes up because compute gets cheaper, so just because hashrate goes up, that doesn’t mean Bitcoin is getting more secure. The only way to measure security is to look at the value of the block reward plus transaction fees (the Bitcoin Security Budget), and block reward is getting smaller so Bitcoin is getting less secure.”

My response: Okay, fair enough to say that compute gets cheaper, so hashrate going up is not 1:1 increase in cost to attack; however, to say Bitcoin security budget exactly equals block subsidy plus transaction fees is not necessarily true because people or entities may choose to spend more on hash than the amount of reward plus subsidies.

For example, 
-companies could choose to mine unprofitably to protect their reserves
-companies could operate a Bitcoin service, such as an exchange, that charges other fees (e.g. exchange transaction fees) and use those to subsidize mining costs and secure the network that they have a business interest in
-individuals could mine for fun or to support a network that they believe in
-nation states could spend infrastructure budget to support the network that is critical for their economy 
-and on and on and on…

Of course my plan is to just HODL the BTC and only worry about taxes if I need to liquidate for cash.

My accountant says that because I sent out BTC there was a taxable event and I will need to track these transactions. She also suggested I only return the fiat USD equivalent at the point of return as opposed to the amount of BTC that was originally paid.

Am I over complicating this and should just use a 3rd party Lightning wallet? Alby Firefox add on for tor browser seems to be recommended? Or is there another non custodial Lightning wallet on iOS I should use instead that will connect to my node?

I finished med school in 2019 and I'm now working as a resident since the last 3 years while also doing some basic research. To boost the Bitcoin network/economy (especially during the upcoming recession) I will try to offer free medical consulting based on the lastest evidence. 

You can ask any medical question and I will try to answer it.

There are a lot of limitations to medical online consulting so please do not expect miracles. I will always tell you whether I can help you with your request or whether it's better to go to a clinic/hospital for further diagnostic/advice. 

Depending on your request I may also need some time to research the topic and study the latest guidelines, so please be patient.

If you have a question please send a private message. I do not recommend to post the question as a comment below. Even though reddit is pseudonymous you may never know whether your question(s) here can be linked to your real life identity and whether you may suffer some disadvantages if you are looking for a new health care insurance.

If you want to send some diagnostic reports make sure that you remove all your personal information (name, birthday etc.) from it.

In case you want to share some reports/results I still need to figure out a way to receive them in a secure (I'm afraid of malware) and anonymous way for both of us. Maybe someone here has an idea? 

Depending on your geolocation, the cost of your healthcare system and/or the maliciousness of your healthcare professionals you may be able to save some money and buy more sats instead which benefits all of us.

I also created a tribe on sphinx chat (if you are using this app) called ""medical consulting"". It's also free if you are running a lightning node.

I have no idea how this is going to turn out, but I will try my best.

&gt; All cyber security incidents are derived from software control signals that weren't sufficiently constrained. Adopt a protocol where control signals must be collateralized by #BTC and then suddenly you have a way to physically constrain control signals. This is a big deal.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine if it cost 1 sat to send a tweet. To you it would be inconsequential. To a state-sponsored bot farm it would be too cost prohibitive to run a bot/spam farm. Imagine if all programs did this. Goodbye DDoS attacks
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; People just have no idea how much of a big deal this is. Once we start getting APIs that leverage #BTC lightning network micropayments, it's going to transform cyber security AND national security.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sats represent a receipt received for spending computational power. If you present a sat, you present proof of power. It doesn't matter if that power was sourced from a hash farm on other side of the world, sats = real world physical power receipts = cyber power.
&gt; 
&gt; It should be obvious to people why transferrable cyber power (proof of real world physical power) is a BIG DEAL for security. Gives people the ability to physically constrain the abstract power and control authority of people &amp; software in, from, and through cyberspace.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the idea that #BTC represents not just money, but also cyber firepower. That would imply its value is derived from the amount of physical power (watts) it channels into cyberspace for people to use to secure what they value.","Jason Lowery, the guy from the US Space Force/MIT makes great points about the importance of Bitcoin for National Security/National Defense.",0.92

But when he presents the Strike option, he makes it look like $100 sent is  $100 received, but this is in fact not true, since Strike charges the merchant 1% in fees (all according to Strike's own support when pressed on the subject).

Fine Strike might be a better solution overall  (I don't know?), but the point is that Mallers is very dishonest in his argumentation for Strike, is he not?

I trade in btc p2p and I use swish payment method, for the first time I used Handelsbanken and after 4 days of trading the suspended my account And asks question, I answer them , then they ask me to kyc the buyers and make sure it's the name in ID matches swish name , and I did that and extra I make the buyer take a selfie holding his/her ID , after a week of that I got order 10k from foreign name (he kyc himself) and the name match swish, Handelsbanken suspended me , and send me a letter telling me that I'm accepting Criminal funds, and they give week to withdraw my money, and they shutdown my account permanently 

So I moved to Scandiabanken , and I'm selling things on tradera and blocket again using swish , my account got frozen after 1 week.  And when I try to get bankID from them they kyc me ,and now 4 weeks and I did not get a code , and let's not talk bout how rude their customer service are

6000,1666467090,False,"This isn’t a complaint. I just want to share my experience as a noob using the coinjoin feature in Sparrow wallet.

My Bitcoin journey has been slow but enjoyable. I’ve recently got up and running with a Citadel node which was amazingly simple to get up and running. Even linking up Blue wallet and Sparrow wallet to my Citadel node hasn’t been too bad either. Although I’m not sure how stable my Sparrow wallet connection over Tor has been.

This is really where my inexperience has been challenged most. My first coinjoin mix went through without any issue. My consecutive mixes there after however have not been so speedy or reliable. It’s taken me several days to make some progress in this area. As I didn’t anticipate any issues after the first mix went so smoothly. I had been following the BTC sessions tutorial which was easy enough to follow. However the consecutive mixes to a cold wallet in the tutorial appeared to happen very quickly. This wasn’t my experience unfortunately.

I seemed to have an error in the log relating to Tor proxy control port 9051. I still haven’t exactly resolved this but have used the below instructions to troubleshoot. Hopefully it helps others:

https://linuxconfig.org/install-tor-proxy-on-ubuntu-20-04-linux

I still have an error and port 9051 doesn’t appear to be working for me.

But since I plugged an Ethernet cable into my Linux laptop running Sparrow wallet, the connection to my node seems to be more stable and the consecutive mixes are going through although very slowly.

This is my main point. The speed of the coinjoin is not the issue so much. It’s just no tutorial has set reasonable expectations for how long the subsequent coinjoins would take after the first. If I had known I wouldn’t have been as concerned. So hopefully my account provides some reassurance to other noobs and sets reasonable expectations. It’s taken most of a day for 7 coinjoins after the 1st initial coinjoin.

Good luck all. I’m really loving the tech and the educational journey so far! I hope this post helps others on their journey. As I have benefited from so many others who have shared their own challenges and experiences. So it’s great to finally be able to start giving back a little to the community:)",Sparrow wallet coinjoin experience.,1.0

Assumption is that the following are somewhat constant: 

1. Demand for bitcoins 
2. Hashrate 
3. Energy prices 
4. Hardware costs

In 2044, the mining reward will be \~0.0977 BTC. With the above assumptions, 1 bitcoin should be worth \~$1,000,000 then. 

In 2056, the mining reward will be \~0.0122 BTC. With the above assumptions, 1 bitcoin should be worth \~$10,000,000. 

Thinking: 

As far as I can tell, the above four factors are more or less what dictate the value of the mining reward in fiat terms, which is currently, \~$125,000. 

Bitcoin price = Mining reward in dollars / mining reward in bitcoins

I looked up both definitions in order to understand more, investopedia notably, but as others info, they mostly talk about the aspects on value/price, where we are looking at supply, (coins available for purchase).

When specifically searching with words like  ""bitcoin supply deflationary"" and ""bitcoin supply disinflationary"", I end up with solid informations, basically explaining the same things, but some use deflationary, and others use disinflationary.

*I said bitcoin is designed to rise in price because its supply is deflationary.* 

Should we rather say ""disinflationary""?

What I want to say is that, Bitcoin is designed to rise in price because it's been designed to have less and less bitcoins available (for purchase).

I say this 1 because there is the halving, 2 because people buy to hold.

Some of the others are as low as 3! The gulf between Bitcoin and everything else is as wide as the Pacific Ocean.

Hi fellow BTCers,

Having issues with BLOCKCHAIN .COM, I am aware that this is a common theme in the realm of things - as it seems that they simply do not care.

1. 2 transactions equating to approx. $800 total.
2. Reset my trading wallet with seed phrase.
3. Tried to send crypto out of my account.
4. They froze the account functionality (message - account restricted).
5. Customer service have stopped responding and have not given any explanation for over 3 months.

Is there anything I can do ?

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PNRGINDEXM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PNRGINDEXM)

Unlike in 2008 Inflation is completely out of control.

The most important cause is still ignored or even denied.

USD money supply was expanded by 40% in 2020 and 30% in the EU. This has never happened before in recent history. This is an expansion that is unheard of in first world countries.

[https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2)

[https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m2](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m2)

Not surprisingly an excess of money will drive prices up. Too much money chasing  too few goods.

This is  a much bigger factor than supply chains or higher energy costs.

One can clearly see how the CPI went up and up with the expansion of the money supply. It takes a while to show up in prices.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)

I think it will take  a while for the public to accept how much of an negative effect central bank policies have on their life and how much of it could have been avoided if people in charge had been more responsible.

Keep in mind these are the same experts that told us:

1. there is no inflation.
2. Inflation is transitory.
3. We can manage a soft landing.
4. There is no recession.

I had 0.04003364 BTC total in my wallet.

I set up  **0.00001362**  BTC as a fee.

After checking my transaction on [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com), it seems like those **0.00022002**  BTC were sent on a different wallet entirely, as in they are not part of the transaction fees or the requested send amount?  


I have used samourai wallet for a long time now and never had an issue like that. But recently I had to create a new wallet, and both output transactions that I've made on this wallet resulted in some funds disappearing somewhere.

basically 1 BTC will always be 1/21M. So the proportional value of 1 BTC (once all mined) will always be 1/21M EXACTLY. No deviations, estimates, or counterfeits to account for, just strictly 1/21M. Now I’m not making a claim of economic value I’m strictly speaking in terms of mathematics. 1 BTC has an absolute value compared to all other bitcoins. That’s the amazing part. 

Compared to fiat and gold which has fluctuations in supply. There can always be more dollars/gold created (or even destroyed) which will affect the inflated value of your dollar/gold. Basically there is never an exact proportional value to fiat/gold so it will never stop inflating/deflating as it’s baked into the ecosystem. Plus counterfeits, cost of transfer, so on. Just incredibly inefficient at maintaining value (a real number not a “perceived” value).

Don't worry, I'm not gonna buy anything from them (maybe) but I am just curious if these groups are a waste of time or actually legit. They say their members in trading can make upwards of $500 to 10s of thousands everyday, and the members inside this group chat are actual real people. They send pictures of Bitcoin or stocks (I can't explain what it is cause I don't know, but it's sometimes in reference to gains and losses). And they also talk about their day, things like that.

Even if you bought at $200 per Bitcoin (way early), and sold it today that's only 100x. So your $1 investment is $100. Not millionaire stuff... You needed to invest $10k back 2017 for that to happen. (Those that got lambos mined it early, or invested thousands in it)

So what will happen???

Nobody can predict the future, but I think it's likely to go to 10X in the next 10 years  and I think it may go to 50X in the next 30 years if we are very lucky. That's still great. You would need a savings account with 13% compound interest to achieve that, it's brilliant. 

There is also a chance for a 70% drop, but I personally think it's unlikely and that 50% from today is the worst you could see. 

So invest in it, hodl it, spend it, use it, and get all the incredible benefits of using it (see many longer posts about decentralised banking)..... But don't invest your spare change in the hope to buy a lambo next year. It's not happening.",Bitcoin doesn't buy you a Lambo,0.74

I look around and everyone uses credit cards and loans to buy just about everything their whole lives. I haven’t read the original white papers, and maybe this was part of the plan, but how would that work exactly? 

Would Bitcoin “whales” become the new banks and lend out Bitcoin? If everyone quit borrowing so much, the system we have would completely break down 100%. But I know it could work. In fact, if you ask anyone 80 or up (probably) they’ll tell you nobody borrowed money for even large purchases like vehicles or homes in their day (US). People had savings and society progressed. Is this a hidden reason why there’s so much opposition to Bitcoin? 

All I ever hear about is privacy concerns and ultimately, the ability to stop crime. But a paradigm shift like that, from debt to non-debt, seems like it would be an even bigger disruption to those who currently benefit the most from the debt system we have.

Doesn't matter what one thinks about the conflict, one principle was always considered sacred in international trade - Private property. The EU boss today [laid out her view](https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-231962) that a legal framework should be put in place to allow the EU to use Russian confiscated assets to help Ukraine. 

This is a travesty because it legalizes stealing assets and diverting them wherever the people running the show want. Today you may think it's for a just cause, but the precedent is as ugly as they get. Tomorrow they'll seize your assets, just because, I don't know, you oppose the current government?

To the average nocoiner this means nothing, but to governments around the world, and rich people around the world, the message is loud. 

Bitcoin fixes this. There is no bureaucrat, elected or not, dictator or other authoritarian that can take your Bitcoin if you have control of the keys. They may kill you, which they always could do, but they will not get your coins by just signing a document.

6417,1666733358,False,"There's this colleague of mine who told me they have some Bitcoin while we were having a conversation during a coffee break. They had their Bitcoin on one of the well known exchanges and I explained them that Bitcoin on an exchange is the equivalent of fiat currency in a bank account. The usual ""not your keys, not your coins"", you know the drill.

Surprisingly, they knew that very well but they had been postponing the withdrawal because they were afraid that something could go wrong as they are way far from being a tech savvy person and easily scared to do anything that is not sending a message via WhatsApp or checking their emails. I offered to help but we didn't really manage to schedule a day and time to do this for various reasons up until last week.

This colleague came to my desk asking for help with some IT issues related to their company laptop and told me that they are going to leave the company in January to focus on a different career path as a freelancer. They said they wanted to hire me privately to teach them how to withdraw Bitcoin from the exchange, how to use a private wallet and they also want my technical support to tidy their whole digital life as they have been using the company devices for personal use for too long and they are now struggling to keep their personal accounts and their work accounts separate from each other. They were pretty serious about it and they even asked about my hourly rate as this is something that I was going to do outside office hours for obvious reasons.

Last weekend we met at their house for our first session and I made them create a 24-word seed phrase on BlueWallet. They wrote down the words on a piece of paper and I made them delete the wallet just to be sure they were able to recover it just in case. They typed the 24 words in BlueWallet and there was no issue so at that point I urged them to take a break, lock the phone and take the piece of paper away from the table. I went outside for a smoke, they went in another room and put the piece of paper in a safe place, and once back I guided them through the process of withdrawing their Bitcoin from the exchange. While waiting for the notification of the received funds, I showed them around the app and explained the various settings, the new receiving addresses that can be generated and so on. A couple minutes later the notification pops up and their Bitcoin is in their private wallet.

At this point we have to part ways because they have other people coming over and they ask me to send them my bank account so they can pay me for my service. While I am on my way home I send them a message to tell them that they can pay me in Bitcoin if they want and they say they are ok with it as long as we do this together in person as a first time.

Today we were both at the office and they came to my desk to pay me. I generated the receiving address on my phone, made them scan the QR code, set the lowest fee, and in few minutes, my dear toxic maximalist plebs (LOL), I got my first payment in Bitcoin.

I am now a private IT consultant for a Bitcoiner that pays me in Bitcoin. What a time to be alive.

I am a 33 year old who has had to work and pay for rent since I was 19 years. I had a breakdown at around 27 due to a bad breakup, depression, alcohol and drugs when I blew through all my savings.

I got back on my feet, got some savings over these last years and I am now constantly working overtime to put some aside and studying at night in hopes of a better wage in the future. But always paying stupidly high rent that is getting higher. Now I have around 7k euros and the inflation is destroying my savings... I cant buy a house still, and my old car will die eventually. I have been reading a lot about finance and investments lately, acompanying markets, basically trying to make sense of it all. I put some money in low risk investment funds, and see where it goes, but it will never give me much.


Then there is Bitcoin. I do not understand a lot of it, but I have been studying its history. I read somewhere, when BC was around 18k usd, this guy saying that the worst that can happen if you put 1000 dollars in BC is lose most of it, and the best case scenario is earning enough to change your life. That kinda stuck to my mind, and Ive been holding myself from putting a good chunk of my savings in BC. I mean, Im not buying me a house, travel much or get a new car as I am right now, but I can still eat and have a roof over my head without my savings. Im just scared that in the future Im gonna need the money I lost in a bad investment.

I guess I iust need to hear someone say ""Do it""

After re-reading my post it does feel like a downer! I am not THAT miserable!

I just wish I could have more, or could see a brighter future ahead of me, without so much uncertainty.

6462,1666766326,False,"Consider the inherent characters of fiat and Bitcoin:
- Fiat starts distributed, then over time, concentrates around the entities that are close to the source of printing and lending.

These 1% of people will never want the system to change and currently have the political, military power and media power to keep this system going.
- Bitcoin starts concentrated, but distributes over time, the distribution at this exact moment is not “ideal” in many people’s view. However, on its way to become ever more distributed, it offers billions of “fucked” people in the fiat world a choice to “opt-in” to a safe financial place where their wealth is much better protected.

6559,1666823483,False,"Before the haterade: bitcoin continues to take more and more of my net worth. And not because the price is up-I continue to move assets such as real estate equity and extra income into it. I have been a vocal supporter. This post is about a real discussion.

1. I have heard a very constant remark as a rebuttal of bitcoin's volatile price swing: ""Bitcoin is the best performing asset of all time."" True. However, let’s compare it to housing.

Let’s say you had 200k in 2017.

Person a buys bitcoin let’s say at 10k. InVestment is now worth 400 K.

Person b Buys a $1 million house in Los Angeles -2017.  They put down that 200k as down payment. The day that house is worth 1.8 to 2,000,000. Even if we go on the low side/1.8, the 200 K is now worth a million.

Keep in mind this assumes that they bought the bitcoin at 10K. 

What I’m saying is that I think that saying “bitcoin is the best investment of all time"" needs some asterisks.

2. While I respect “fix the money, fix the world” My interaction with bitcoin Maximalists is becoming more unsettling. Am I the only one? Do we live in a world where the goal is to only have 1 thing of value? And if we only have one thing of value, who really benefits from that? Also, I saw many bitcoin promoters who were called out in the Celsius blowup.

3. From an investment point of view, I no longer believe that the halvings are truly correlated with price. I think there are a lot more data points-Dxy, fed balance sheet, inflation, etc.

4. Do you believe corporate adoption coming? Would really like some opinions on this. Besides Saylor, I don’t really see it.

5. Is there a year or price you would call it quits? For me the answer is no because I believe the federal government simply cannot run with rates going higher. The interest expense is too high. The government debt must have negative real rates. So for me it’s a bet that I’ll stick to. But I’m curious how others feel.",Before the haterade,0.5

On the home screen is now a privacy progress bar, showing the size of coins and their privacy level. This view can be expanded to see a progress ring, with additional information about the coins. Also included are the usual bug fixes and performance improvements.

Its obvious now that the global 0.01% (in terms of wealth) have taken control of the system, they don't hide it anymore. They own our governments and media.

They hide their money in offshore trusts and so don't need to pay tax.

A blockchain based financial system would be transparent, we could see everything that happens and where money flows.

Africa, for example, is a net debtor of £155bn. There are net flows of over £900bn to offshore trusts, the elite in Africa and western countries are robbing an entire continent, because we can't see where the money goes.

BTC fixes all of this.

I visited China in 2017 and everyone used an app called WeChat, you could also pay anybody via QR codes. Why can't we integrate this? Because the 0.01% won't let us.

I don't know about you but it feels a bit helpless.

6740,1666935721,False,"Contrary to what many people believe, the current monetary and financial system is very recent. This experiment, unilaterally decided by Richard Nixon in August 1971, has celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2021. The current system is therefore relatively young.

The least that can be said is that this system, which is not based on anything tangible, has completely failed in its mission to stabilize the world economy.

Worse still, inequalities of income and wealth have continued to increase since 1971. The current system is therefore clearly failing. It allows a minority of people to become enormously rich by imposing unfair decisions on a majority of people.

At the center of the current system is the U.S. dollar.

The U.S. dollar has been the world’s reserve currency since 1920 and has reached the average life expectancy for a world reserve currency. Many people question the possible end of the U.S. dollar’s hegemony in the years to come.

Many are aware of the limits of the U.S. dollar, but they point out that the U.S. dollar cannot lose its status because no credible competitor is emerging behind it.

These people think this way because they limit their field of vision to fiat currencies. You have to look beyond these fiat currencies to understand that hard money that has been growing for more than 13 years now can be a credible alternative to the hegemony of the U.S. dollar in the future.

This hard money is Bitcoin.

Neutral from a political point of view, Bitcoin is a currency with absolute scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined. Bitcoin’s monetary policy highlights the virtues of quantitative hardening.

While central banks have the power to print endlessly fiat money out of thin air, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated in this way. It represents a total paradigm shift from the current system. Bitcoin is much more protective of its users.

Bitcoin belongs to its users. It gives them a power that belongs to them by right, and which the current monetary and financial system has deprived them of for too many years now.

Buying Bitcoin is to vote against the current system and, above all, for a fairer world in the future.

I think there are (at least) 3 fundamental philosophical differences between Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar that make all the difference:

1. Bitcoin gives you freedom, the U.S. dollar requires that you ask for permission.
2. Bitcoin represents progress, the U.S. dollar represents stagnation.
3. Bitcoin promotes fairness, the U.S. dollar promotes cronyism.

Bitcoin is a total paradigm shift from the current monetary and financial system where the U.S. dollar has reigned as the hegemonic king for 100 years. Bitcoin gives its users the freedom they should never have lost. The U.S. dollar has gotten you used to ask for permission when the power is in your hands.

Rather than continuing to stagnate in a flawed system, you need to open your eyes to the progress that Bitcoin represents.

The fairer world that Bitcoin builds will put an end to the cronyism that the current system has always fostered. By buying Bitcoin, you will be making the choice to take control of your destiny for good.",The 3 fundamental philosophical differences between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar,0.83

6801,1666977760,False,"Dear Elon, here are my ideas for Twitter:

1) Twitter sets up a Lightning node (soon to be largest in the world, by far)

2) Users can continue as before with their accounts, or they can opt to open a lightning channel with Twitter, and fund it to earn a star color.

3) Depending on the level of funding that is put into the user's Lightning channel, the user is assigned a star color. 50k sats (~$10): red. 200k sats (~$50): orange. 1M sats (~$200): yellow. 5M sats (~$1000): green. 

4) This channel funding is fully refundable at any time.

5) A user can choose to direct BTC to any other user for any reason via Twitter Lightning instantly at no cost. Charity, purchase goods or service, gift, streaming fee, etc. We are long overdue for a system that allows free, instant, global money transfer between humans, within a virtual town square of hundreds of millions of users. If desired, the user can just leave the BTC sitting there to maintain their star rating - there is no requirement to spend money. 

6) If a user breaks the Twitter terms of service such as abuse, bot behavior, etc, then other users can report them. This will be reviewed by a team at Twitter or a panel of volunteer user reviewers trained for the role. If the user is found to have violated the ToS, then first offence is warning and next is a fine of half of the funding of their Lightning channel (a financial cost to the user).

7) If you report a post/comment as violating the ToS, but the reviewers find that you did so disingenuously (clearly to harass someone) then you are warned, and next time subject to a fine. This is a financial incentive to play by the rules.

8) Proceeds from fines will be awarded daily to a random user in a lottery. What fun.

9) Users can choose in settings which star level comments/posts are visible to them. Most users will likely choose to hide posts/comments from no-star users because many are malicious and/or bots. If bots are trying to operate without financial cost, they may quickly find out that their audience is small and shrinking. This incentivises users to fund a star on their account due to an inferior user experience without a star, and puts a price on bots.

10) Channels can choose to only allow certain star levels to subscribe. A higher star level implies a higher level of trust and commitment to following the rules as there is more to lose.",My stupid ideas about Twitter and Bitcoin,0.47

6895,1667025227,False,"Upon login, I see a banner stating that until I verify until the 12th of Nov, I won't be able to execute any transactions.  

I tried verifying via various documents. Even if  my verification goes through, the banner keeps appearing, consequently blocking me from doing literally anything. I'm caught in a loop of hell.

When I registered, I had a different name, than I do have now (marriage). So I uploaded my verification documents. My new name appears just fine during the verification process as does everything else. The only ""issue"" is that I reside in a non-EU country while my pass is from Germany. 

It says country of residence ""Germany"", but my address is noted as a different non-EU one. I mean, everything is noted, no difference in my verification documents.

I contacted the support twice, in English and in German - but no answer.

The thing is, the settings on ""account restrictions"" shows that  I have no restrictions, but as soon as I return to homepage or the transaction buttons, I get that damn banner again. The app won't work on my Android phone, in my current country of residence.

&amp;#x200B;

Without being able to sell my coins, I can't turn them into EUR. Without EUR, I can't withdraw anything. Without being able to withdraw, I can close or change my country of residence via the settings (which I shouldn't have to do, since I verified everything over 1000x). The best would be of course to gain access again and move my coins to my wallet. I have done this for my friends and waited to do it for my own account... here we are.

I’m not a moon boi, just trying to get some perspective. 2. Am I being unreasobale for looking at Apple stock, Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, etc. observing thier ROIs over the last 30 years and believing that BTCs performance will be far surpior because of the scarcity and the opportunity it brings to the world?

Does it mean Earth will be the only one to have true Layer 1 Bitcoin and separate planets will have each a Layer 2 solution that will communicate with Earth (like lightning)?

Imagine how insane it will be in 1000 years if they look back at Earth as the origin of L1 that the whole species is using.

The gist of it is that many nodes don't transmit more transactions than they receive, and thus only serve to increase the ""average propagation latency"" of the network. The only such nodes that are useful are those that represent ""economically active Bitcoin users"" (whatever that means).

Also, on the other hand, if new dip is coming ((which I personally expect in the next couple of months), we will hold that position, as every significant dip stayed the dip at least for a few days, it never jumps back up the same day, so I have the time and I can hold my fiat in the bank, and once we hit the dip I can go to the bank, remove limit on the account and transfer fiat to exchange and buy BTC.

Today, I will explain why the government isn’t stopping shit.

Remember the Vietnam war? A lot of people think that the US lost because the Viet Cong build tunnels &amp; hid underground; guerilla warfare. But they miss the larger point. 

What they effectively did was decentralize their forces. 

Cut off one head &amp; another one emerges. Capturing &amp; torturing a Viet Cong soldier was of no use. He had no significant strategic secrets to share and couldn’t tell you where all the tunnels were located; because these Viet Cong groups fought largely independent of each other &amp; carried out their own tactics. They just shared a common goal: beat the anti-communists.

The decision to go underground wasn’t something they had trained for, nor planned for decades. It was improvisation; a decision born out of the necessity to fight differently when facing an opponent superior in brute force.

Bitcoin did not adopt the dark. It was born in it, molded by it.

It has been preparing since day 1 for the war that is coming when it steps out into the light. We are not there yet. When we are, you will know.

Governments are great at ‘smashing things’ with their hammer. They can smash people, organizations, even other countries if their hammer is big enough.

But you can’t smash an idea. An idea that represents itself in the form of a decentralized network that diligently keeps a ledger. Bitcoin exists in the realm of ideas, it is not technology, although it arises from technology.

It is not a person nor an organization or a particular nationality or race, although it contains all of these. It is an idea, and the great thing about an idea is that it can be shared by all of us.

If you know the US had a hard time beating the Viet Cong, imagine them trying to beat an idea that is shared by a student, a young father, a single mother, a professor, a CEO and a retiree; in total millions of people all around the world.

Independent thinking people, all with their own spheres of influence, using a network build with the intention of withstanding a nation state level attack. 

We overestimate how powerful the government is against the type of non-violent, decentralized warfare we are waging. That's why they haven't made a big move yet: they don't know what to do. They will try to come for us when they realize just how existential the threat is to the current system &amp; status quo, but they won’t be able to identify a spot where they can hit us with a killing blow. 

They can hurt us, but they can’t win.

*Hi friends, as you know I'm Venezuelan ""living"" here, crypto enthusiast.*

*We see a drop this week, to 27 BTC, still around 120 USD monthly.*

*Remember this is only measured using LocalBitcoins. There are other exchanges where the volume is higher for sure, like Binance (king here) where you can use P2P to use Bolivares to get crypto. Reserve is another one, same with AirTM.*

*Monthly minimum wage now under 16 USD. Average around 100 USD, a manager can make maybe 400 USD.*

*One BTC is around 190,000 Bs. -Bolivares-  (remember in the last 15 years, 14 zeroes have been removed from the currency, without doing that BTC price would have been 17,000,000,000,000,000,000 ""pre2007"" Bs.). Last week it was 170,000 Bs.*

*Crypto has been used for years here so people would exchange  their Bolivares as soon as possible! Years ago having any coin besides Bolivares was almost a felony, so people went to internet and found ""internet"" money haha.*

*Some people use them to send  remittances to their families here and also people mining (house electricity is free, here mining is more profitable).*

7146,1667182232,False,"Without getting into the fine details, I felt I needed to warn others of the potential issues that could arise when doing business with Wattum.

Earlier this year, I entered a purchase and hosting agreement with Wattum. The total hardware purchased was approximately $95,000 with an expected launch in early July 2022.

Following several hosting delays, both parties decided to terminate the hosting agreement in late August 2022 with the expectation that they'd send me my purchased hardware.

Unfortunately, when it came time to ship my miners, Wattum didn't actually have my hardware. I informed them this was a breach of the original purchase contract, which specifies that the miners purchased at the time of the agreement were within Wattum's possession and control - which was clearly not the case. I then promptly asked for a refund.

Now for the past two months, Wattum has repeatedly asked me to accept alternative equipment. They typically either email or text me a new offer every 2-3 weeks, then ghost me every time I ask for a refund. They are essentially holding my money hostage until I accept a new deal. Money which they were never entitled to in the first place.

I am definitely not the first person this has happened to with this company ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tq9wup/buyers\_beware\_of\_wattum\_management\_inc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tq9wup/buyers_beware_of_wattum_management_inc/)) but hopefully I will be one of the last.

I have filed wire fraud charges with my bank and am in the process of ironing out details with a Lawyer. Next steps are filing a police report, FTC complaint, and potentially FBI complaint.

I will continue to update this thread and pursue all legal means as necessary until I receive my money back from Wattum.",Warning! Avoid doing business with Wattum Management!,0.87

7199,1667227993,False,"**Preface:** This discussion spawned from a debate between a friend and I, about the benefits of someone currently running their own Bitcoin node, and the true value of doing so. Would love to get public feedback on this discussion and understand things that we are missing, and where we have some knowledge gaps.

**Full Node Benefits View One:**

* The main benefits of running your own node are privacy, and being philanthropic. You are able to propagate transactions yourself, and aren't sending your data through a third party that can understand more about you. You can be truly private with your Bitcoin by running your own node. Doing so is also benefiting the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, and you are doing everyone a favour.
* Diminishing returns in decentralization: Bitcoin going from 5,000 to 10,000 nodes decentralizes the network more than going from 10,000 to 15,000 nodes. Each marginal node added is less added decentralization.
* While running your own node is the pinnacle of using Bitcoin, it is not necessarily a security flaw to use modern wallets that connect you to dozens of other nodes. Bitcoin in its modern state has enough nodes out there that randomly connecting to 10-12 in a third party wallet gives enough certainty that your wallet is displaying the correct data.

**Full Node Benefits View Two:**

* The main benefit of running your own node is security of your funds. Being able to know with complete certainty that the funds you are sending and receiving truly are Bitcoin and not some random forked coin.
* In the future, everyone will eventually run their own node in their home.
* If you are not running your own node, you are not truly using Bitcoin.
* Third party nodes can not be trusted and have the ability to redirect your coins and/or not send your transaction.",Benefits of Running a Node: An Open Discussion,0.9

7283,1667287426,False,"My initial strategy is basically to max out my retirement investment plan and invest the rest in Bitcoin.

My long-term goal for retirement is around $750k-1m at age 60, this is a lot if you’re living in 3rd world.

In order for me to achieve that, I have to invest $6000/year in US and global index funds for 32 years. Due to high income and low cost of living, I can invest $6000 within 5 months. The rest of the months of my disposable income goes to Bitcoin. 

Regardless, if Bitcoin missed the adoption or goes to zero, I’m still aligned with my end retirement goal. I’m not open to other local investments since we have a garbage stock market performance and a corrupt government social security. I feel safer investing in US or Global assets and Bitcoin at the moment.

Currently, I have a portfolio of 77% in Bitcoin and the rest in index funds based on this approach. This concerns me a little bit and I don’t know why.

I have 2 ideas in my mind; (1) keep accumulating Bitcoin and rebalance once we break ATH or (2) invest less in Bitcoin and start investing more in index funds.

7414,1667369815,False,"$8/month for account verification to combat bots essentially confirmed. LN tipping service already built-in to Twitter. Elon has hinted at plans to accept his favourite shitcoin.

It would have to be an active decision to not include Bitcoin LN payments for the account verification they plan on adding, as Michael Saylor suggested to him in (roughly) the first quarter of this year.

Edit:

There seems to be a bit of doubt from a few here.

Jack Mallers made a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jackmallers/status/1587787339237130240?s=61&amp;t=o3p9h62OgOWuHTlLRkNq3Q) in reply to Elon about 40 minutes ago mentioning the following;

“Lightning (instant + near-free #bitcoin  payments) should be an accepted payment method.

Would allow for global, inclusive, private payments (important for pseudonymous users) that are cash-final (no chargebacks).

Services like @CashApp already support these payments”

And

“My company (@Strike) partnered with @Twitter to enable Lightning tips. We even offer the ability to settle these payments in USD, so there is no extra lift for @Twitter (settles and reported like a card payment)

This can be implemented in days given we already have a partnership”

—

Bitcoin Magazine, whom Elon has spoken to numerous times on Twitter also said;

“Let's make this happen, for the better of Twitter @elonmusk”

So, he is very aware that it would be almost as simple as the flick of a switch to enable Bitcoin payments for his Twitter subscription service.

Time will tell, but I feel confident in saying it will happen either at launch, or shortly thereafter.",It is safe to assume we will be seeing Twitter accept Bitcoin payments for account verification very soon. Thoughts?,0.76

7432,1667386024,False,"This is from the Market Wizards book (Jack Schwager,1988). The author interviews Richard Dennis, one of the most succsessful traders ever. He was one of the few relevant democrats in the investment sector, a world that was dominated by republicans, and he was heavily intellectually invested in politics. This was written more than 30 years ago and it feels more relevant than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**As a long-time market observer, what major trends do you see shaping up over the coming years?**

I bet we will be at record levels of inflation by the end of 1990. It is going to be driven by trying to avoid a deep recession. The recession is going to be caused by the federal budget deficit as investors require higher and higher levels of real interest rates to buy the debt. The' government will try to avoid the recession by stimulating the economy, a tactic which essentially doesn't work.

It is, unfortunately, a very Republican idea, but I think it is right. Whether you like it or not, the financial markets are in conservative hands. People who lend money to the government and business will not buy monetary easing as a solution to a recession.

**Are you implying that the deficit problem is just a time bomb, which will eventually shatter the economy?**

Sure. We tend to think that since it is not a problem now, that means it won't be. We expect continuity in our lives, but the economy, and certainly the markets, are more discontinuous than continuous.

It is like having termites in the foundation of your house. You may not notice them until one day they gnaw away a big chunk and the house collapses. I don't think anybody should take a large amount of comfort in the fact that things appear to be holding together.

**Hypothetically, if you were President and could influence change, would the deficit be the first thing you would change?**

Sure. I think it is especially important for Democrats, since they were the first ones to pick up the banner of Keynesianism \[the advocacy of government programs to increase employment\], to admit that while it may be a great theory, it doesn't work in the real world.

**I don't think Keynes ever proposed using deficit spending in strong economic times.**

No, that's true. He proposed surpluses that were supposed to be countercyclical to deficits. Surpluses in good times; deficits in bad times. The trouble is that we have only one side of that equation because of the lack of political will to create the surpluses when times are good. So what we really ought to do is admit that Keynesian economics is just an excuse for easy money, overspending, and overconsuming. We ought to just admit that the government is a debt junkie and the whole concept of deficit spending is flawed in practice.

**You mean Keynesianism as it is being applied, not Keynesian economics as he himself purported it?**

The theory is fine, it just doesn't work in the real world. Therefore, we shouldn't use it. Besides, Keynesian economics was a solution to the problem of oversaving and underconsumption, which was a fair enough attempt to pull us out of the Great Depression. The problem now is the exact opposite: undersaving and overconsumption. Even if Keynesianism were politically tenable, you still need a different solution because you have the exact opposite problem.

**Is there an economic theory that you feel fits the times and makes sense?**

We have to get rid of deficit spending. We need to retire the deficit in some orderly way, and the federal government should have to balance its budget just as the states do. At that point, Milton Friedman's proposal for a constant money supply adjusted by a growth factor would probably be a good idea.",Keynesianism doesn't work in the real world.,0.75

First, I’m only interested in Bitcoin and not the other aspects of cryptocurrency.

If I understand, the idea is that Bitcoin could replace all other currencies and a quick Google shows that there is somewhere around $6 trillion of hard currency in the world.  Also, I believe that there will be at most 21 million Bitcoins ever minted so if Bitcoin replaces all currency each coin should be worth at least $250,000.  That all makes sense. 

So if I buy some Bitcoin today am I supposed to spend it or save it until it hits $250,000 and then start spending it?

I believe that transaction fees are around $1 so If I buy a $10 item at a store the fee is still $1?  That’s too high for small purchases so should I only use it for larger purchases.  But for larger purchases I currently use a credit card or write a cheque.

I don’t understand how I’m supposed to use Bitcoin like cash with fees that high and then if I spend it and the value goes up to $250,000 then I’ve lost a lot of potential.  Really the question is if everyone hodls and no one spends Bitcoin how is it supposed to replace other currencies?

7611,1667498107,False,"I was commenting on a post on this sub regarding the ways of buying of crypto, and from the doubts that a lot of people had regarding P2P, I decided to make a detailed post on how to use P2P method of buying crypto through Fiat. A lot of people don't know about this crypto buying method.

P2P method is the method of buying crypto directly using your local currency from the sellers across the country. I will try to simplify the method using screenshots from Binance P2P Page. We are going to consider two persons : Person A and person B. P2P method is extremely useful in third world nations like India, where banks restrict the fiat deposit in Crypto exchanges.

So, the entire process looks like this.

1. ⁠Let's say person A wants to buy 100 USDT via P2P. So, he will go to Binance P2P page, where he can scrolll through and find sellers ready to sell the required amount of USDT for INR based on local currency rate. 1$ is around 86 INR. The rates shown below are also based on supply and demand.
2. Let's assume that ⁠Person B is selling 100 USDT via P2P on the binance. He has created a sell order for 100 USDT with a price of 1 USDT for 88 INR. A is interested in this order. So, he clicks on B's sell order buy option (green). The bank details are mentioned by B in his sell order. Whenever a person creates a sell order, Binance will freeze his corresponding assets and acts as an escrow. 
3.  Person A after entering the fiat amount, and pressing the Buy USDT option; an order is created by the binance. Now, A has to transfer the Fiat amount (8800 INR in the example) to B, using the bank transfer method mentioned by B.
4. Person A transfers the amount to B, and after getting the confirmation from both, A and B regarding the transaction, Binance will transfer the frozen USDT from B's wallet to A's wallet and the P2P transaction gets completed.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case where there is any issue in the transaction or disputes between the parties, binance will act as a middlemen; After going through the proofs submitted by both the parties, a conclusion is reached. for ex: If the buyer didn't sent any amount and lied that he did, Binance will ask for the proof of transaction, failing to provide will lead to temporary deactivation of account.

So, here, Binance simply acts as an escrow and no fiat amount is transferred from or to Binance. So, banks can see that person B transferred some fiat amount (10k INR in our example) to person A, but they can't find out the reason of transfer, and hence, they can't block or restrict this transaction.

As the transfer is between person A and person B, and Binance just acts as an escrow, it is known as peer-to-peer or person-to-person (P2P) facility.

In case of any doubts, please ask in the comments.

However, the current range is way below the crypto market prices registered during last year’s bull run. A large section of Bitcoin investors are still trading in losses thanks to the prolonged bearish momentum in 2022. For a large part of 2022, the curve for Microstrategy Bitcoin holding followed a sideways trend with 50% overall loss over the investment.

7635,1667506726,False,"I have been a bitcoiner for a few years now. I am currently in an advanced (Keynesian) macroeconomics class and it has made me question some things. 

If there is a bitcoin monetary standard in the future… how will businesses get credit/loans to operate their business? Without credit businesses would innovate much much slower, productivity would go way down. Less employees they can hire, etc. 
It would be much harder to get a business off the ground, and take so much longer to build up a business than if you had cheap credit. (I understand the consequences of cheap credit) 

Hence there must be bitcoin “banks” or exchanges that distribute value between savers and borrowers. 

Since bitcoin is decentralized and no protection from a central bank, I can imagine there would be bank runs all the time. The loans to borrowers would be very illiquid and the liabilities of savers who deposited their bitcoin would be very liquid. This is what happened during the Great Depression. 

Hypothetically, all the bitcoin depositors would pull out of the exchange and the exchange would become Insolvent. 

Therefore lending/credit would be pretty much non existent in a bitcoin standard? Therefore output and productivity would greatly go down? Therefore standard of living goes down?

7684,1667558699,False,"**Bitcoin does not have any utility.**

Bitcoin is money and money does not have many uses other than being money. It's an intrinsically worthless paper without any other utility or an entry in a database. That being said, money is one of the most important inventions we ever made and modern civilization could not exist without it, Money is only useful for financial uses: that means it is either a medium of exchange, a store of value or an unit of account. It's boring but very important. Money is a &gt;$100 trillion market and Bitcoin can fill some niches within this market and capture a smaller or bigger percentage of it. Whether people use it as digital modern version of gold, as a decentralized saving account, to make uncensorable and irreversible online transactions, remittances, micro-transactions with LN, as an alternative to banking where banking is not available, protect themselves against hyperinflation of their local currencies or against corrupt regimes, or just add it to their investment portfolio to diversify all of these are legitimate uses of bitcoin for which there will always be  a certain demand.

**Bitcoin is a zero sum game therefore it can't be an investment**

A lot of things people invest in are zero sum investments. Gold, art, wines, currencies, commodities, derivatives. options, futures are all examples of zero sum investments some of which have existed for hundreds or thousands of years.

**Bitcoin does not have an intrinsic value therefore the fair value is zero**

A lot of things that people buy or invest in don't have an intrinsic value. Gold, art, collectibles and fiat currencies don't have any intrinsic value and yet they have a constant value above zero.

**Bitcoin consumes as much energy as an entire country.**

This argument is often used by journalists trying to manipulate their readers. Why use country but not compare them to the energy consumption of other things? Video gaming and tumble dryers consume as much energy as Bitcoin but no one perceives them as energy wasting. Country is used because people perceive countries as huge but they perceive gaming or dryers as small and insignificant sources of energy consumption.

In reality Bitcoin uses only 0.15% of global energy worldwide a fairly insignificant number. Cattle farming is estimated to generate 15% of global greenhouse emissions, 100x more than Bitcoin and yet some people seem to be feel far more threatened by Bitcoiners instead of meat eaters.

**Bitcoin can't scale**

This does also imply that because Bitcoin can't scale now it never will. The truth is that while the base layer has  a limited TPS capacity, Bitcoin doesn't need to perform all it's transactions on the first layer so claiming that Bitcoin as a technology can never scale would also assume that no building on second layers will ever happen which is of course contradicted by the fact that efforts are being made to build on second layers. As demand for transactions goes up there is an incentive to build more capacity on other layers of the network.

**Bitcoin is too volatile**

This does also imply because Bitcoin is volatile now it will always be that volatile. There is no reason to believe volatility in Bitcoin is constant. Volatility is  a reflection of market maturity. 2012 Bitcoin was far more volatile than 2022 Bitcoin and that trend to lower volatility will continue. Recently Bitcoin was less volatile than the Dow Jones or Nasdaq.

7701,1667565047,False,"If institutions adopt BTC as a store of value and it's stolen from them by hackers and they can't get it back, then they could collapse.

If these institutions  go begging to government for a bail-out on the basis that they're '*too big to fail*' and government  simply gives them tax-payer money like they did in 2008, this is like hackers stealing money from *every* taxpayer. 

Consequently it's unlikely that institutions will ever adopt BTC as a treasury asset because the. insurance costs would be prohibitive. 

However: there's another risk here which is being overlooked. Let's say for a minute that Proof of Work is designed to allow recovery orders of stolen Bitcoin, such that institutions *can* get it back if it's stolen, then they *could* use it as a treasury asset *BUT* the value of BTC would most likely precipitously drop *if it's demonstrated that recovery orders can work so institutions could still be in the position of going to government for a bailout if they adopt it before a recovery order has been demonstrated.* 

In other words, it's a bad idea for institutions to adopt BTC as a treasury asset either with or without recovery orders being possible on the network.

7713,1667567014,False,"TLDR: Before you purchase make sure the price is around the actual Bitcoin price and not some inflated price, specifically binance. Make limit purchases.

The main reason I'm making the post is to shine some light on this for those of you that have recurring purchases. I think those recurring purchases are most likely getting you less coin than you should be getting and you might not even notice.

About two weeks ago I made my weekly purchase of $50 of Bitcoin. I never really pay attention to any of the details I just do it really quick when I have time (that's on me I'm not looking for sympathy). I noticed after the purchase that the price of coin I got in my quote was around $21,2xx while Bitcoin was still at around $20,3xx. I thought wow that must surely be a typo or something but it wasn't. After emailing back and forth with binance this is what I learned (I'm sure most of you old heads already know this):

Binance farms out the easy purchase portion to third party traders. They don't check them in any way and they don't seem to care what price they offload to the consumer. I can appreciate if it was up a little but it's not even close to the running price. 

If you want to ensure you get your money's worth, use a limit purchase. I know this has been said in here before.",Check the price when purchasing coin.,0.91

7718,1667572558,False,"The following Satoshi symbol idea was inspired by the work already done by the preeminent [Sats Symbol](https://twitter.com/SymbolSatoshi) and the newly introduced satoshi symbol of combining an ""s"" and the ""@"" symbol by [Bitko Yinowsky](https://twitter.com/BitkoYinowsky); their symbols were recently shared in a tweet by [Bitcoin New Daily](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily) in the following post:[https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily/status/1588176449856368641?s=20&amp;t=bZvNyyw0tNv5pur5L4wvbA](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNDaily/status/1588176449856368641?s=20&amp;t=bZvNyyw0tNv5pur5L4wvbA)

Before I post my idea, I'd like to highlight some key factors that affect how powerful a symbol is, monetarily and culturally speaking. A strong symbol:

* Speaks to the meaning of what it represents, often in multiple/different ways.
* Must be distinguishable, even if the differences between it and others are subtle.
* Ideally, especially for a currency symbol, it needs to be easily replicable/written/expressed.
* ""Less"" is often ""more""; K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid).

Of the two ideas put forward by **Sats Symbol** and **Bitko Yinowsky**, I must say I prefer the former, as it perfectly marries together the ideas that while [satoshis are bountiful, abundant, plentiful](https://satsymbol.com/), the total number of bitcoin is inexorably approaching the limit ([Unicode character ≐ U+2250](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2250)). Having said this, a currency symbol IMO derives its practicality from how easily/quickly it is written. I am concerned that nocoiners will find it alien, or simply ""too much effort"" to write out (I know, its pedantic, but a consideration nonetheless).

Which is why I appreciate Bitko Yinowsky's symbol, as it's already very familiar looking and legible. However, people have pointed out that the ""@"" symbol is not expressed consistently in other countries, who's cultures may apply different pronunciations/attribute different meanings to the ""@"" symbol, which presupposes that the symbol only really ""clicks"" with English native-speakers.

As I said, I took inspiration from both ideas, as they both have merit. So here's my (albeit crude) symbol submission:

&amp;#x200B;

[satoshi](https://preview.redd.it/4wgwc7pyxxx91.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0969b62ef706537b9e1661855f2f5214eb8e7bb3)

* Bitcoin's symbol is the capital letter ""B""; not to say the satoshi symbol must be comprised of the letter ""s"", but it certainly maintains continuity.
* The legible-flow of the letter ""s"" is in keeping with the ""stacking sats"" mantra; DCA, DCA, DCA.
* The diagonal through the middle of the ""s"" is similar to the Sat Symbol (丰), and connects the ""s"" together, reminiscent of the **infinity symbol ∞**:
   * Under hyperbitcoinization, everything will be priced in terms of bitcoin (∞/21M)
   * Every 10 minutes, billions of satoshis ebb and flow across the network, like an infinity stream.
* Besides infinity, the diagonal also makes the ""s"" look like the number 8; as most bitcoiners know, satoshis are fractions of a bitcoin expressed to eight decimal places; one bitcoin is 1.00000000 BTC, or 100,000,000 satoshis. The symbol provides a mental-anchor point, subconsciously reminding users how many decimal places satoshis are expressed, in terms of whole bitcoins.
   * In the case of dollars and cents, the latter ""cents"" comes from the latin ""centum"" meaning ""hundred""; $1 is made up of 100 cents, with dollars and cents fully expressed to two decimal places, e.g. $3.50.
* To nocoiners, this symbol is reminiscent to the dollar symbol ""$""; English speaker or ESL (English as Second Language), the dollar is entrenched in our collective international psyche (although, however similar it is, I hope you agree that it is distinct enough!).

Had I had full-access to Adobe Illustrator (as I do normally), I could've rendered a much higher quality version, however for the purposes of sharing the initial idea, Paint sufficed.

I hope to encourage critical discussions, creative thinking, and above all the idea that nothing is determined for us already; we are all clearly so early in the overall bitcoin adoption cycle. Bitcoin as a protocol is open source, and is strong because of it; I'd like to think all aspects of Bitcoin can remain open and accepting to thoughtful discourse, as who knows what new uses Bitcoin will address beyond its use as a SoV/UoA, and it's ability to transfer wealth across time and space.

7729,1667576375,False,"Hey all,

I was given a paper by a university professor about how governance on the blockchain should be designed. The paper says that the governance of Bitcoin occurred by need since it got so popular and it was never considered in the initial plan (plan maybe not be the right word).  
Anyhow.  
There is a couple of sentences in the paper but I cannot understand how this can happen.  
I have some knowledge of blockchain but nothing specific about how bitcoin works, so I figure maybe one of you has an idea.  
The sentences are the following:

Ultimately, the most important parties regarding governance are the Bitcoin miners. These miners run the Bitcoin network by executing software, and they decide whether to run a new version of the Bitcoin protocol by means of upgrading their software. In case sufficient miners decide not to run the newest (or: a competitive version), and the newest version relaxes the protocol, a hard fork occurs, which in worst case results in a new currency. One could consider the occurrence of a hard fork as a failure in the governance process.\[ Decentralized Governance in blockchain networks is a design problem \[Governance in peer-to-peer networks is a design problem, 2020, F.Kaya, J. Gordij, R. Wieringa, and M.X. Makkes\]

7762,1667602080,False,"I'm at the point where I'm getting a bit more comfortable with self-custody/cold storage where I'm ready to move forward with multi-sig.

I see in Sparrow where I can create a new wallet, but this makes it seem like the private key is then on my computer (I'll explain more why I may be missing a key piece of understanding below).

I also see where I can add the signing devices and the scheme (2-of-3, 3-of-5, etc) and saw a video on using PSBT exports and imports where those devices become the multi-signatures required to move.

Is there a way to confirm the address shown in Sparrow is a multi-sig using my Umbrel node (via Mempool in the Umbrel)? This would help reassure me that even if the private key from Sparrow is on the PC (and backed up) that it's not a ""normal"" hot wallet since it requires mutli-sig to move.

Is it more like Ledger Live where Sparrow has the wallet, but the private keys are on the devices themselves (and not on the PC)? If so, do I just set up those other devices like I would if they were regular cold storage 1-of-1 devices with addresses and 24 words backed up as normally done then later essentially link them together in Sparrow as 2-of-3 for example?

I also see multi-sig detail export from Sparrow in a few different formats so you can properly reconstruct the multi-sig setup if your computer were wiped/crashed.

Using 24-words you can backup with steel/metal, but is there a preferred way to back this multi-sig info? Is that safe for something like cloud storage and an SD card in a safe or something like that to prevent a fire taking out your computer and the backup)? I'm assuming it's alright to back this multi-sig file up in multiple less secure places as it's not the actual private keys or given it's multi-sig?

In sparrow when you create this new address and set it up as a multi-sig, going back to the standalone 24-word backups for signing devices, how would I backup this Sparrow address or is there no real backup since it creates no private key and those keys instead reside on the signing devices and they're backed up as you normally would backup a wallet there?

Since you'd have an address then on each signing device (2), what happens if you send btc to those addresses instead of the Sparrow address? Does it just behave like 3 different addresses where one of the 3 requires multi-sig?

I think I'm somewhat close to understanding this, but really would like to get a better grasp of what's happening under the hood so to speak and want to make sure the backup process is sound as well as my understanding of the flowchart of how this works.

I've tried to find videos, but not sure they quite go into the nuances I'm trying to learn or figure out in this (perhaps I'm more fundamentally missing something and a piece of information missing would make it click for me).

Thanks for any help trying to clarify some of these gaps in understanding for me and sorry if some of this seems basic, but want to understand it a little more before setting it up (will still test with small amounts first).

I understand that fiat money has made this inequality worse because of credit expansion and asset bubble that follows it.

I don't want to get all political, but I've been following the situation in UK where the new PM is a guy with 700M net worth. Let that sink in. To my knowledge, the policies he is proposing is mostly benefiting the rich, small tax cuts for regular people, bigger ones for the wealthy. I see this same thing happening everywhere where the game which is being played is sort of class-warfare against the working people. The kind of thing Chomsky is raving about. I think that once the majority of the population realizes that they've been screwed by the policies and lobbying(read corruption) there will be calls reforms. While I like bitcoin for the idea that it's censorship-free and permissionless, I also see it as a problem in terms of inequality. Wealthy people have the cash flow to scoop up bitcoin and slowly escape to a realm where you can not re-distribute the wealth evenly amongst people. It really does worry me. I know the situation right now is bad, but it doesn't mean that re-distributing wealth amongst people would be impossible.

I might be in the minority here with these statements and owning BTC would mean that I would also benefit from this realm shift, but I don't feel as it is morally the ""correct"" thing to do.

Anyway, take this as you will and would love to get some feedback on my thoughts.

For the divisibility, if BTC comes to be use for 5% of the world wealth 65 trillion $ it we be above 154 millions dollar/BTC, 65 000 000 000 000 000 \* 0.05 / 21 000 000 = 154 000 000$  but you will not be able to trade by 1.5$ step (1 satochi) it s insufficient divisible... If half of the world wealth enter in BTC it will be 15$ steps... It miss 4 or 5 zero or units more... It s not so well thinked...

Than the big difference with precious metals is that BTC have an open register, and you can know how many BTC are in a wallet just with the wallet address... Crazy?! Yes for long distance transaction is interesting but not for saving and less and less for daily transaction... That make a useful price of BTC between 3000 to 5000$, down the energy cost for mining, so... RIP

BTC today is the typical image of an absurd comportement autodestructor... 

There is more and more problem but you can't say what you just say. Make the calculation by yourself with the hashrate for the enormous BTC electric consumption just today, than think. There is different cryptocurrencies and many are less efficient than BTC using a ton of electric power for nothing... (a part of 2.0 Ponzy sheme) 

Listen that please : 

Bank use few cryptography because they have their own intranet. And you know why? Why they didn't use cryptography? Why did they build an intranet for them? Because cryptography use too many energy!!!! They knows it! BTC technology isn't new!!!

For me cryptography is a nuclear button of internet. It can destroy it. But one thing is sure, Cryptography is destroying our real world for any utility. 

Stop walls (cryptography) and make bridges (open source). Interne tis a virtual world we don't need walls or money in it, we need to understand it. Internet is like a universal and free library it have to be free. If printing machine was kept in the church hands for Bible our world will be really different no? Crypto and internet is near the same. Don't change internet for an undispensable monster it's just a library, not a selling place or publicity medium... 

To finish, many transaction are artificials to keep the appearance... How it s possible that more than 10% of all the bitcoin have moved today???  It s like this every days...

*Hi crypto friends, it's me just updating this week data.*

*This  week has been crazy, exchange rate went up and now monthly minimum wage  is less! Also Central Bank released the inflation data:*

* *September - 28.7 %*
* *Octobre - 6.2%*

*This is MONTHLY!*

*Monthly  minimum wage at 130 Bs. at the street exchange rate (9.68 Bs. per USD)  is around 13.4 USD MONTHLY at the official rate (8.6 Bs per USD) is 15  USD MONTHLY. Average wages are around 100 USD monthly.*

*One BTC trades around 207,000 Bs. (Bolivares)*

*This  is only a gauge using LocalBitcoins as they have public stats. Others  exchanges used are Binance (the king), Reserve among others.*

*People  use crypto to escape inflation (even stablecoins), to receive  remittances from family abroad and also to exchange and trade as  worldwide (adding the fact that mining here is really cheap, as  electricity so far is free). Years ago having anything different that  Bolivares (which is crap) was a felony!*

1. I sell it for profit. I'd claim that as a taxable gain, sure. Easy case. 

2. I attempt to purchase something and accidently send it to the wrong address. That isn't a capital gain but how would I prove that to the IRS?

3. I attempt to purchase something and get scammed and a scammer runs off with my bitcoin. How does the IRS know I was scammed and didn't legitimately obtain some goods in return?

4. I gift family members small amounts of bitcoin. How does the IRS know I am not in control of the wallets I sent it to? 

5. I attempt to move money between wallets and make a typo and send it to the wrong place. How do I prove I actually lost it and don't secretly have the key to the wallet(s) it ended up in?

In summary, it seems like we could be taxed for all crypto we bought regardless of what happens to it (legitimate capital gain or completely lost) because we will never be able to prove it isn't still in our possession.

8011,1667809732,False,"Proof of Work is a competition between miners where miners have to *burn*  *energy more efficiently than their competitors to win blocks. (\*Edited)*

This sets up a situation where miners must buy energy at lower and lower rates for longer and longer periods to secure better prices, plus they need to vertically integrate into ASIC chip manufacture to secure the best chip supply chains.

This means Proof of Work is an Economic Function where miners must incur a real cost, which they then need to cover by selling their commodity (Bitcoin) back to the market. Consequently, they attach economic *weight* to the Bitcoin commodity and will typically refuse to sell it at a loss.

So Bitcoin is a '*data commodity*' and it has economic '*weight*' and mining is an economic '*function*'.

The consequence of any economic function is to become more *economical,* which inevitably means a few large pools will always dominate the mining process.

The answer is simple: it's the knowledge that makes all the difference and allows you to have absolute confidence in Bitcoin to be patient.

It's a virtuous circle you need to get into.

First, you will want to buy Bitcoin and learn more about Bitcoin. After you start learning more about Bitcoin, you will be pushed to learn more about the economy, money, and the current system.

As you discover the flaws in the current system, you won't be able to help but come back to study Bitcoin again to understand how Bitcoin intelligently addresses the flaws in the current system.

This virtuous circle will then allow you to focus on the Bitcoin revolution and take the long view. With a long-term vision, you will be able to HODL Bitcoin no matter what.

2, Saving btc for dependent
Also, if I want to buy for my 3 year old, I’m guessing the only way to do it (since there is so much KYC/ DD required to set up on exchanges) is to buy in my accounts and move to a hard wallet for my child? Would there be tax implications for her/ I if I did this? Eg, IHT/ CGT. Assuming we don’t sell until she is 21. 

3, Storing btc safely
On soft wallets, are these any safer than storing money on exchanges? Or are we just as vulnerable to having our btc held ransom?

 Now, with all the FTX rumours, have withdrawn all BTCs from FTX to my hardware wallet and don't want to use it anymore, atleast till things get clearer. 

What is the potential way forward for me, for weekly withdrawal? I could think of some options below:

1. Withdraw that 50k sats directly to my hardware wallet weekly. Drawback: Too many addresses with smaller balances which is both tough to maintain and also later will have to pay fees to withdraw from each.

2. Withdraw that 50k sats directly to my hardware wallet weekly but use the same address. Drawback: As people say, this reduces privacy. But still I am not very clear what privacy I am losing. The exchange am withdrawing from already knows my address(es) irrespective of it is same or different. Others looking at the blockchain may know I am DCAing. What others they can know? Why not I use the same address, I don't quite get that part.

3. Withdraw that 50k sats to my Muun wallet - different address every week and withdraw from Muun to hardware wallet after a sizable amount. Drawback: While withdrawing from Muun to hardware wallet, Muun too charges cumulative fees to withdraw from each address. This am not sure. This would be the preferred option if fees is not a lot.

4. Withdraw to Muun on same address every week. - if fees for option 3 is a lot, then trade off privacy and withdraw weekly to same address. Once moved a bunch to hardware wallet, start using a new Muun address.

8189,1667919228,False,"Hi all,

I know someone that is struggling with an old bitcoin core wallet from pre-seed phrase days. They are unable to authorise any outgoing transactions when loading the wallet.dat file into a freshly set up copy of bitcoin core. This wallet has not been active since at least 2017 and the password has not been changed (I/they are certain of this as the wallet wasn't touched at all immediately following a transaction back then). This password worked previously but now they cannot get it to accept with modern bitcoin core. 

 I know that 99% of the time these things boil down to 'oh darn, turns out I did change the password after all', but here's the thing; the wallet is encrypted with a password in Russian Cyrillic. I read somewhere that Cyrillic letters can require some different kind of decryption, however my contact has successfully used this password many times up to 2017, at which point they stopped using the wallet and have been unsuccessful in accessing it since \~2020. 

Are there any known issues with Cyrillic denoted passwords and modern versions of bitcoin core, and could this be remedied by downloading an older (circa 2016/17) version of core? They have incredibly slow internet so attempting this would take over a month and I don't want to waste their time.

Anyone that believes FTX failing has any impact on bitcoin's long-term future doesn't understand bitcoin, IMO.

When Bear Stearns and Lehman crashed were pundits calling for the collapse of the value of a Dollar in the long-term.

There were short-term implications on assets during the financial crisis.

But bitcoin's potential place as a global monetary asset in the future has nothing to do with the prospects of an exchange.

One argument I think is valid is that this could slow the adoption of bitcoin. If I can't trust one of the most well known names in the space to hold my bitcoin than how can I trust bitcoin.

I have to clarify cause some of the comments I think (could be cause my bad wording) is that I'm asking ""if I should take it"" I (actually got 2k in btc) from a giveaway but I don't know if I should hold it im new to owning crypto and the whole idea of it so I was asking for answers by people smarter and more aged about the situations of crypto


Another edit: 
the crypto that was given was sent to a wallet I made via exodus the giveaway god this sounds silly was a ""last to leave"" on discord, winner got 2,000$ (I was the winner) and now I'm wondering about what I asked above

(sorry shit grammar) I've explained this really poorly I think judging by some of the comments being fixated on the giveaway I want advice about dealing with crypto btc specifically I want advice from people whose been investing and knows alot youtube is a choice ofc but I feel like it's better to have conversation cause YouTube videos might not answer what I'm thinking about

To answer the questions in the comments that I don't want to constantly reply to:

1. Yes I have a wallet made.
2. Yes I have the phrase etc backed up on paper from exodus.

3. Yes I have already gained the 2,000
4. No I don't really know much about crypto specifically bitcoin because that's what I have and I'm learning but I'd like to hear opinions on good sell times maybe what to spot cause Yes videos cover it but personal experience and hearing personal experience can really help me

They are essentially a middleman letting people trade their own coins (Alice buys BTC for $20k that means that someone else, Bob, is willing to part from his 1 BTC in exchange from $ from Alice). All the exchange does is facilitating the trade and takes small cut per each trade.

Obviously the platform needs developers and infrastructure which needs to be paid from these trading fees. But this is simple math: are the trading fees the exchange earns more than the operating costs. This is not something that changes one day to another or even one week to another.

Bitcoin is like Michael Jordan, The GOAT, but he doesn't play in the NBA.

No he plays in a Rec League at the YMCA, with every jabroni that can put on a tank top.

To watch him play, you don't get a nice seat, with parking and concessions and merchandise to buy

You get to stand on the sidelines, in a gym with no A/C, and watch a hundred clowns run around, like chickens with their head cut off, try and play with him. They can't play defense, they're stupid, they are horrible athletes, and they miss 90% of their shots, but they act like they are really playing the game well. They think this is time well spent, doing something productive

This is what ""crypto"" is to the average person, looking at it from the outside in.  These are the sh!tcoiners, playing with Jordan.  Jordan is just trying to get a sweat, stay in shape until he can get into the NBA.

It would also be analogous to Muhammad Ali, when he was exiled for 3 years from boxing, and he had to make speeches, stay in the gym, do an exhibition here and there, to stay ready for reinstatement into the professional world.

The world sees this Crypto circus, this storm of thievery and stupidity, from bad exchanges to  snake oil salesman VCs, pumping-and-dumping sh!tcoins, swirling around this space, saying they are the next Bitcoin, and they average Joe is supposed to separate the wheat from the chaff?

Bitcoin is tarnished by the company it keeps.  Guilty by association.

Bitcoin and ""Crypto"" are two very different things.  Like Jordan in the Rec league.

The outside world would never know it.  They think we are all on the same team, playing the same game.  That's the problem with Bitcoin.  

It's not Bitcoin.  It's us, acting like chimps around it. The optics are horrible.

Not Bitcoin's fault, but this is the lot, the ghetto, Bitcoin lives in.

Bitcoin is not ""crypto"". Bitcoin IS the breakthrough. ""Crypto"" (tokens, alts, all that) are only possible because Bitcoin showed it was possible.

Bitcoin is a network, a protocol, and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthroughs in history - the invention of digital scarcity. It allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy (PoW). Bitcoin is a public utility that has no owners, no rulers, no backing of any state or corporation, and a conception that can never again be repeated in history.

""Cryptos"" are ""projects"" that tackle ""use cases"", raise funding, have employees,CEO'S, board members, foundations, and can easily be censored by a state. 99.99% of crypto is created to enrich the creators, with retail as exit liquidity. **All of them will trend to zero against Bitcoin**.

Bitcoin is an alternative to central banking/modern monetary policy run by volunteers and can be used by anyone and everyone. It does not discriminate. It is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information. The Bitcoin network is for moving and storing value.

""Crypto"" is not much different from fintech companies except they use a slow and expensive database and print their own treasuries at the push of a button. Sure there might be some interesting use cases, but literally all of them can be done without a blockchain.

Understanding that Bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step. The deeper you go into that rabbit hole, the more questions you ask, the more you put Bitcoin under a microscope, the more mind-blowing it becomes.

Bitcoin is **not** ""crypto"".

I see Bitcoin, the internet, remote work, and proliferation of english (the language) composing to distribute away the power centers of nation states, banks, and corporations. Not sometime in the distant future either, rather around the end of this decade we'll see the EU alliance break, DAO's form in smaller African nations, and Palestine's imports match their exports.

It will become a real challenge for government's to levy taxes. I think we're starting to see this begin already. That means even more aggressive money printing and the militarization of tax agencies. It won't work though. Governments will have to incentivize their own citizens to pay taxes. And this will require projects of immense value with transparent accounting. The prestige politicians have enjoyed for so long will fade, as their powers get distributed to the people, and real solutions without symbolic affectation are required to govern.

When the Lightning Network is ready (nodes, liquidity, and user growth is currently parabolic), maybe by 2025, Bitcoin will enter its transaction phase. Whole coins won't be so much a thing as Satoshis or ""SATS"". The law of diminishing returns will have arrived. Gone will be the days of 1000x gains and large volatility. The gains will become smaller and slower. I expect this to begin at .01¢ SATS, which would correlate to a $1M bitcoin which would give the network the entire market cap of gold currently ($11T), still small, and we'll still see large gains until ♾/21M, but they'll be smaller and the dollar peg will fade.

A robust DeFi ecosystem will also be built on and around Bitcoin. That means smart contracts. The Taproot upgrade will kick this off in earnest which will only augment network effects and utility. Bitcoin adoption is growing at a faster global pace than the internet did in the 90s. One reason for this is because the infrastructure is already built. When ""open source"" satellites blanket the world, allowing a transaction in Patagonia or the Arctic as easily as NYC, government's can do what Elon Musk suggested they do when he was asked about regulation of Starlink over Afghanistan: ""*They can shake their fist at the sky.*""🍀

I posit Bitcoin will be man's final money, just as Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be man's final invention.

This is mostly due to the way bitcoin leverages energy, as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison crudely figured out 100 years ago in 1921. What most fail to realize is that the only physical currency in the world is energy. See, energy is required to have a standing military, to start a small business, for nation states to exist, for transportation, globalization, and maybe most importantly to communicate.

Bitcoin then, uses energy to guarantee an individual's property (BTC), and secure its network. This is much different than the approach POS consensus blockchains take. Their governance is a conversation everyone wants to side-step and pivot towards the other two parts of the blockchain trilemma they've solved. MONEY, has nothing to do with TPS, throughput, or tx cost. Those are all features of a blockchain. Many of us grew up under democracy and assume its angelic ideals are best applied everywhere. Well they're not—especially on blockchains aspiring for global adoption. The first problem is there's no way to know how many people own how many tokens, which makes the allocation of voting power impossible and unfair. Another problem is there's no way to curtail collusion. Another is that 50% of the world's population lives in two countries (China, India), and that percentage is only growing. Another is that voting is a skill. And after something is voted on and passed, token holders against the change(s) have no ability to opt-out. We won't even bother going into the tokenomics many of these projects boast.

Bitcoin does away with this nonsense by guaranteeing immutable rights, having fixed issuance, and tethering itself to the physical world by leveraging physical infrastructure, none more important than energy. Whether you have 1000 Bitcoin or 100 Satoshis doesn't matter. There's nothing one can do that the other cannot. There's no voting, no securing the network with staking, no special privileges, no collusion. And on the consensus layer, if a proposal is agreed upon by 51% of the hash, it's optional wether a miner wants to implement it or not, meaning they can opt-out.

Bitcoin's first attraction is greed, but below, it quietly disburses freedom and distributes away the center of power structures. Bitcoin pollutes the environment from an economy of scale (cheap electricity, access to capital), but below, it quietly incentivizes green energy, making it competitive regardless of fossil fuel affordability. The end result of this trojan horse is going to be fascinating to watch, and how fast it degrades nation states or finances sci-fi alternative energy projects might surprise some.

**My judgement, a warning, and if you don't mind, a tinfoil hat.**

All of this doesn't happen without manifesting very real problems during its transition phase, but whatever you're doing in life currently, it should be geared towards acquiring more bitcoin. I'd even suggest temporarily taking on a second job for the task. Now for the tinfoil hat:

As friction (technical difficulty) of wallets and hard wallets collapses, privacy and UI improvements will skyrocket. This means the first thing to break will be:

— World government's ability to levy taxes effectively, which will require an enormous increase in money printing, and the militarization of their tax collection agencies

— The second shoe to drop will be mass municipal bankruptcies, as cities are already crushed under the weight of pension debt which they carry in hopes of getting federal bailouts, because this debt is unserviceable and staring down the barrel of compound interest. With pensions gone, fireman, police, your water, teachers, parks and recreation will become unstable.

— Climate change. How will cities finance the infrastructure needed to combat worsening droughts, fires, and flooding? Much of the entire state of Florida for example (flattest US state) has serious flooding issues nobody wants to talk about. The entire lower half of the state's coastline needs projects totaling over $1T to combat sea-level rise effectively. This will all lead to migration and people on the move. Those global caravans traveling to Europe or El Norte through Mexico will number in the millions weekly.

— Healthcare, Social Security, and all social services collapse.

— The world rearranges itself rapidly, and those with the world's new reserve currency (bitcoin) remake it in their image and likeness.

Don't leave your blood on the streets. Maintain your health, keep a bicycle, buy a concealable weapon, and HODL bitcoin. You'll be fine. Good luck!

8529,1668021735,False,"A few years ago I started searching ways of making money and how to invest it. I made a good amount with a business that lasted for about a year.

Meanwhile I discovered **bitcoin**, at first I only saw it as an investment and didn't know much about the technology, so I bought a little with some other shitcoins (at the time I didn't know the difference). It wasn't much. The price was going up, so I started to learn more and more about it.

I stumbled across [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/c/aantonop/videos) and then I realized what bitcoin really was.

I realized my bitcoins were not real, I bought them on eToro, they held the private keys and didn't even let me withdraw to a wallet of my own. I immediately started the process of getting my money to buy real bitcoin (it was very complicated, don't use that scam website).

After watching hundreds of hours of Andreas I knew that bitcoin is nothing like all the other ""cryptos"", that anything that isn't bitcoin is a scam, that you shouldn't use any exchange ever, and that you should have your own hardware wallet and and protect your seed phrase.

After I learned all of this, I was more interested about the technology and it's implications in our world. I'm not gonna lie, I still wanted to make some money so I bought more, this time for real.

The next months after that, the price dropped 80%. I ""lost"" 80% of what I had bought.  
But luckily, by then I knew that I didn't lose any bitcoin, I still had the same amount I bought and I knew the price was going up forever. I wasn't thinking in short term anymore, I started thinking about the next 10, 30 and 50 years. Luckily, I was smart enough to buy more.

While everyone was panicking, saying that bitcoin was dead and that it would never recover, I was buying as much as I could.

I had the money to buy a brand new phone that I really liked? Nope, ""buy bitcoin instead and this money will buy a thousand phones 20 years from now"". Every time I was about to buy something that I didn't really need, I thought ""do I want this now or a thousand times more in a few decades?""

By now, I learnt my lesson:

* Don't buy anything in ""crypto"" that isn't bitcoin.
* If you want to buy something but you don't really need it, buy bitcoin instead.
* Don't waste your time and money on NFTs, DeFi, pay to earn, exchanges, etc.
* Learn to secure your bitcoin, and educate those around you so that if you leave this world, your money isn't lost.

Yes, price is going down now. That doesn't change that eventually the price will be so high that the question ""how much is a bitcoin?"" won't make sense anymore.

Stop panicking, let the other people go crazy, and **buy their bitcoins for cheap**. They'll regret it just like every person that sold their hundreds of bitcoins for weed.",The first time I bought bitcoin I lost 80%,0.66

However, if you turn off the noise, and consider some of the positive news we've received over the past year, it might remind you, you're still early.  I can't help but view this current bear as, **The Most Bullish Bear Market**, Bitcoin has ever experienced.  To list a few examples,

* [The Fidelity Report - Bitcoin is First](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/bitcoin-first.pdf).  I mean the title speaks for itself.
* [Major banks in the USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/as-wall-street-banks-embrace-crypto-start-ups-look-to-lure-top-finance-talent-.html) and around the globe offering Bitcoin exposure to their clients
* [Energy companies entering into the BTC mining industry](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/oil-companies-partner-with-bitcoin-miners) to help capture wasted energy and stabilize grids.  Companies such as, ExxonMobil, Texas Pacific Land, EOG Resources, Marathon Oil, ConocoPhillips and many more.
* A major hurdle *preventing* companies from adding BTC to their balance sheet has been achieved, [James Lavish can speak to this better than me](https://lookingglasseducation.com/fasb-and-the-bitcoin-accounting-win-yes-its-a-big-deal/).
* The amount being built on the Lightening Network (L2), there is too much to list, but [Jack Mallers strike payment system](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-use-the-strike-mobile-payment-app/#:~:text=Strike%20leverages%20the%20Bitcoin%20blockchain's,rather%20than%20as%20single%20transactions) is remarkable! and we are just getting started with L2.
* [Innovations being built on L3](https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-layer-3-and-its-latest-rise-e80e64c32dd6) are starting to begin and this could be massive for privacy among other ideas.
* Jason Lowery, if you don't follow this guy and have twitter, you should.  Why?  He believes Bitcoin is critical for National Security and is being funded, thought MIT National Defense to provide information why.  The mind on this kid is remarkable. @ JasonPLowery

This is just scratching the surface.  So many innovations are being built, so many more people around the world are starting to understand the answer to the question, ""Why Bitcoin?"".  Chin up everyone, keep stacking those Sats.

I know things seem really hard right now, and I won't pretend to have a crystal ball that can offer any comfort for an unknown future—but for what it's worth I will offer a few patterns I've recognized over the years, as well as a few personal beliefs which have developed as a result of said patterns:

1) If you've invested in BTC then you're someone who has joined a community without borders. There are so many good people here who have weathered so very much. There's value in this community alone. 

2) There's a rigged game/system, and that game ignored BTC, mocked it and treated it like an annoying fly—until it couldn't—and then that rigged system jumped in with both feet because that system is filled with opportunists, not creators. I believe it's those opportunists who are creating a lot of BTC's stumbling blocks as it grows.  

3) There's BTC, and then there's Crypto—one is a movement, the other is largely spillover from the rigged system trying to capitalize on something it can never create. 

4) I've been through days like yesterday and today at least a few dozen times. Without fail trolls will do everything they can to mock you for investing/believing in BTC. It can hurt and cause doubt, absolutely—but remember their trolling mostly happens on obvious red days. That's a clear sign of no courage. Which leads me to the last thought I'd like to share....

5) Courage isn't a singular point—sometimes it takes courage to cash out your BTC because it makes sense for your life situation—some times it takes courage to admit you over-leveraged yourself in purchasing BTC and are now in a tough spot—hell, it takes courage to read legitimate critiques of BTC if you're heavily invested—and finally, it takes courage to hodl on days like these, even if you believe in BTC in the longterm. 

To that end—and this is gospel truth—it absolutely takes zero courage to drop by r/bitcoin to mock hodlers or believers. 

None. 

The shit talking and mocking is going to happen. Unfortunately there are miserable people in the world who love looking for an opportunity to make others miserable as well. They too have a community, and within that community is cannibalism—not a shared belief in something a human-culture changing as BTC. 

So, when you come across some small person trying to dunk on you for your beliefs and the research you've done, or for your desire to exit out of a corrupt system—revert back to this:

There's value in this community alone.*",In 2013 I filmed a feature documentary on BTC.

8708,1668048458,False,"Hello there, a lot of people I see here are on the edge, I see the fear in their posts.

I am writing here because I want to give you my unwanted opinion about money and the way I see them, I’ve read a lot of books, have a lot of experience on how to deal with your own feelings and I understand them pretty well. I know that everything is psychology and I am here to help you today.

First of all let’s start with that we are born not knowing what money is. When we die we leave everything on Earth.

The more you grow up the more you understand money. The more you understand them the more you want them. The more you want them the bigger risks you take to have them.

Let’s never forget how risky everything is. The moment you have made the decision to take all the risks which brought you to this point you must have realised that this may become your reality. If you did not think that such events would take place, if this is your first bear market or if you thought that it’s not going to happen to you - let me remind you that life is so risky that you don’t even get the chance to get out alive.

Enjoy the experience you are having at this point, take everything as a opportunity, as a lesson, as a goal maker.

I’ll point out a few tips on how to change your life around if you are feeling depressed after these events in the crypto world.

This will be a 5-step guide on how to stop feeling depressed and take control of life back to your hands:

1: Achieve a small win within 2 hours. Anything you know that you have to do. If your room is messy - clean it. Or at least clean a little. Or don’t clean. It’s choice time. At this moment you have the choice to make something in order to chance your future. Everything you do has consequences. If you start with something things will be brighter. But guess what’s gonna be in the next 6 months if you don’t take actions. Just look at the last six. Continue achieving small wins every day to boost your confidence.

2. Set a goal. What do you want? Is it something achievable? Have you asked for it? Have you tried doing what you can towards the goal and leave things that are out of your control for a later stage? The problem of you not having the amount of money inside your bank account is because you don’t have a goal. A specific one, on paper.

Tip: set a goal, set the timeframe in which should be accomplished(specific date), write down the plan for achieving it, tell yourself exactly what amount of money you want in you bank account(specific amount). These steps are very important. You should write down everything and read it out loud every evening and every morning before and after bed. The most important thing here is to imagine it. Feel as if you have already achieved that goal. Imagining things turn them into their material equivalent.

Start working with what you’ve got. Everything else will come into place sooner or later.

3. Put a fake smile on your face and believe that you are happy. Keep that smile until you are truly happy. Be kind to everyone, compliment random people, show them respect, remember their names when meeting them. This will bring you new friends. It will bring you a lot of happy faces and good times. Making people feel valuable makes them give back the good feelings. 

4. Think of yourself as of the better version of you you want to become. Think as if you already have the money you want to possess. If you wanna be a millionaire think of you as if you are one. 

5. “You are the major key of your better future.” Write that down and make sure you read it everyday.


These things basic rules have made me a millionaire. I firstly acquired the mindset then everything else came into place. Everything that stops you from the billionaires is the mindset. And the speed. Do not try to find excuses. Before I became a millionaire I’ve had a list of 50 excuses of why am I not rich and none of them was “me” as a reason. And I’ve lived month for month waiting for my salary to arrive. 

You can become the better version of yourself if you start changing things today. Or stay in the same hole as before by not taking actions. You see you cannot change the weather when it’s raining.

8735,1668054990,False,"**Forenote: I NEVER had an account on FTX. I also hold shitcoins, and I'm aware of the risks associated with holding them. And I'm happy to buy bitcoin at today's discount price of 16,000 USD, but we should show sympathy for those who lost money with FTX today.**                

A long long time ago I remember posting somewhere on reddit about the amount of crypto anyone should keep on an exchange. Basically, one response that I got was, ""If it's about the same amount as one month's salary, I'd get it off ASAP."" and that's been my threshold ever since.                

However, there's a group of people who will keep that amount on an exchange for the sake of generating profits or because they don't understand self-custody.           

So, my question is, without any irony or sarcasm or anything like that, ""Is it our fault that people were not immediately withdrawing any bitcoin they had purchased from their exchanges?"" This is how we find out, very quickly, I might add, who is swimming naked.               

I feel like there should be a more explicit incentive to do this.             

**On a side / unrelated note:** I'm absolutely shocked that SBF, having accumulated billions of dollars in just 5 years' time through arbitrage trading, made a mistake that is at Mark Karpeles levels of ""lack of attention to detail."" In every interview that I saw him in, he seemed level-headed, didn't come across as arrogant, and seemed to have a solid idea of what he wanted FTX to do. Did the company have plans to IPO? All I know is they had plans to allow their users to engage in both stock and cryptocurrency trading on their platform. It's just that when you hit ""billionaire"" status, what could drive you to desire more?","Serious: Is it *OUR* fault that the shit with FTX happened?

I don't mind paying tax and reporting my holdings but I do mind having my every sat tracked.

We need to start using DEXs and P2P because CEXs give too much data and power to governments and bankers.

Note my opinion is based in part on the fact that in my country (NZ) the only major platform which has come to dominate the entire market, called 'Easycrypto' were literally established by one of the major banks Corporate Strategy Manager and they have gained exclusive banking service from the banks which has been denied to all other platforms which have been obliterated or forced to operate on the margins with very unreliable intermediary banking service. I believe the banks and government only allow platforms they have some control over if not direct influence over as appears the very likely to be the case with Easycrypto.

Not only do CEXs give government and bankers huge access and influence over Bitcoin, they also prevent the development of decentralised DEXs and P2P and that may well be the reason they are allowed- to give the banks and government the ability to track and potentially eventually take control of the protocol.

Plus CEXs have proven totally unreliable and frequently corrupt and incompetent- if we are going to adopt a decentralised currency, don't we need to adopt decentralised trading too?

Am I wrong?

I don't trade, just buy and hodl. 

I buy on coinbase pro and move to hard wallets. Coinbase is the only less stinking player in the game and I hope it stays that way.

I believe what's happening with these exchanges' shenanigans is good for the space long run. Really burn them all! but the sad part is silly customers are getting hurt with their life earnings.



Edit1: There's some little hate for coinbase in the comments but not as much as I was expecting tbh. Coinbase is awful very so often. 
Firstly, I am not promoting coinbase. I know it can go down too. It serves my purpose of buying and transferring my coins to self custody simple. 

Also, far as I know many institutions and big players use coinbase to settle their purchases and is trusted by many big players one recent example: https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/10/11/google-to-allow-crypto-payments-with-new-coinbase-deal/amp/

You should use any “well know” exchange that suits your needs.
There are some great recommendations and comments on the post. 

One comment I personally liked and endorse is: 
“Treat exchanges like an exchange” Buy what you need and take the self-custody.

The next morning when I wake up, IBD has stopped around 15-20% and I can no longer log into MyNode or Umbrel, and can't SSH into them either. 

I have bought an official Raspi power source. I have that plugged into a UPS. I've bought the 32GB Samsung Pro Endurance mSD for the OS. I have tried two different housings and cables for the 1TB WD SSD. I have a dual-fan casing for the Raspi, and temperatures don't rise past 42 C. 

On the networking front, I've assigned a static IP to the Raspi. 

I'm at a loss as to what it can be at this point. It happens every time (10-12x), and to both OS. None of the new hardware I've bought (power source, UPS, new housing, new mSD) have made any difference. What could this possibly be? I'm at a loss.

**Muun Wallet (On-Chain + Lightning)**

**Casa (on-chain, insanely simple backups)**

9138,1668199583,False,"I was the target of a cybercrime on 10/17 around 3am CT. A hacker obtained access to API credentials on my Binance.US account and executed multiple trades on highly illiquid alt coins to profit on the other side. My account was drained of $125,000 this way in a matter of hours. I had Google 2FA, IP address whitelisting, a unique password, never click on email links and only go directly to Binance.US when logging in.

I created a read only API on Binance in February 2022 for Zen Ledger for tax reporting reasons. One possibility is that I unintentionally created the API key with trade access AND someone hacked Binance or Zen Ledger to get the API public and secret key. The secret key is not visible on the Binance portal even if someone had my credentials. It was never shared since then and I didn’t save it on any devices. In either case, even if I did create the API with trade credentials, Binance documentation states that trade permissions should automatically be disabled after 30 days: https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/updates-to-api-key-permission-rules-2021-07-08-cda0a4b53da04396b5d27881e93abf78

If the hacker had my credentials and was able to bypass 2FA through cookie hijacking, it is only possible to create a new API with 2FA, which I have enabled on my account. 2FA is required upon creating a new API key.

Another possibility is that someone hacked the Binance API bridge directly. The worst case is that this was an inside job. I don’t want to think that it is, but I want to list all options I can think of for transparency.

Binance suspended my account while they investigated. Their only conclusion is that the hack occurred through an API. They refuse to provide other details and are denying responsibility. They said they would cooperate with the authorities and told me to refer to their terms of service regarding my responsibility for security of my account. I had all security measures enabled.

I have reached out to legal counsel and was advised that I reach out to the Secret Service Cybercrimes division, Attorney General and file a local police and IC3 report.

The operation of system can be corrupted, hijacked and misused by malign entities and by apathy and misled, lazy, greedy, sheeple.

The theory of democracy is elegant and essentially fair, but in practice it is never perfect because the human participants are always to some degree flawed.

The core protocol of Bitcoin is similar- elegant, fair and inherently designed to treat all people equally without fear or favour- but people are lazy and use CEXs, ETFs and other centralised and often corrupt intermediaries. The banks and governments obstruct and regulate intent to retain their fiat debt slavery hegemony and their manipulations are often subtle and clothed in heavily promoted FUD, KYC, energy consumption, consumer protection blah blah blah.

Bitcoin is near perfect in theory and in isolation from humans, but like democracy in its interaction with humans the interface can be corrupted. Like democracy Bitcoins ongoing functioning integrity is reliant upon at least some participants goodwill and active participation whether it is protocol devs, node operators, miners, ordinary users, even reddit commentators. 

We can make the operation of Bitcoin protocol stronger by resisting hostile entities strategies to capture and control, rentseek and corrupt the operational integrity of the protocol.

Do not trust- verify.

Use open source systems decentralised systems as much as possible, from device to user interface and trading platforms.

We often talk about accumulation phases, time and time we got it wrong at the end! Most of the accumulation phases endup in a catastrophic crash. Why?

Take is as you want, warning, assumption, prediction ... but note! There are toxic accumulation phases led by toxic whales likely working in a group. Organised crime basically, if you take it through the lenses of regulated markets, and which don't cover the scope of Bitcoin, yet . 

So, organised accumulation phases obviously always involve tonnes of unsuspecting retailers. After ,6 or 10 months, booom! Crash! For month they accumulate, but not for hodling but for dumping. 

When they will dump, well when FTX or similar will strike. It's a bit naïve to believe that FTX it's a one man show and things just happened because of a youngster...because they didn't! For the dumping to appear normal we always need some coverage. What exactly FTX does to Bitcoin? Fundamentally nothing! 

The fear and uncertainties around market places do Not represent a crisis of trust in Bitcoin similar to what Enron did in 2002. Bitcoin didn't submit fake accountancies to dive that badly. So by the look of it some folks are really making sure the general public feel crap only by hearing 'Bitcoin' which today is more associated with failure than ever before. 

Make sure you read correctly the events and adjust accordingly. **No one can tell for sure which accumulation phase is toxic or not, but one** of ten maybe **is not, and will end up with a massive spike somewhere in the near future.** So watch the space with your both years and eyes wide open and make the right moves you feel it's time.",Toxic accumulations vs the Genuine ones - don't ask me for some proofs,0.75

So first of all i never had money on FTX i did make an account like 3 month ago

I dont have any bank accounts linked to id only did KYC

   
 

The thing is this i used the FTX App (Blockfolio) as a Portfolio Tracker

Today i woke up opened the FTX App and it said somethign went wrong so i went to the App Store and made an upgrade and then i opened it again and in the app it made another upgrade

So and like 5 minutes later i went on reddit and yeah so the FTX got ""hacked"" (probably and inside job)

And that you should not make an update wich i saddly did

of course i deleted the app immediatly 

Now i am just a little bit scared that because of the upgrade that i now have a virus/malware on my phone wich can steal my data

I dont use mobile banking only on computer and like i said i never had money on FTX i use other exchanges and hardware wallet still i am a bit worried

The seed phrase is able to convert the words into the private key to restore lost access. What I don't understand is that the seed phrase can restore access to multiple addresses at once, correct? One seed phrase from one software wallet can restore access to a multitude of private keys. Does that mean that if that software wallet provider company goes bankrupt and the app disappears there is no way to use that seed phrase and restore access to the say 10 coins I had in associated with that seed phrase in that wallet? Can I just use that seed phrase in another companies wallet and it would restore my 10 coins there? What if that wallet doesn't support half of those coins? Is that access lost forever? Or is the process of converting the seed phrase into multiple private keys a transparent one and can be run independently of a software wallet and I can just get an output of all the 10 priveat keys outside of a wallet and use them independently?

Secondly, I keep reading that a private key is 265 digits but when I look at private keys they are much less and not just numbers but also letters.

*Nothing much to see here, 35 BTC were traded here measured only LocalBitcoins. Monthly value is around 120-140 BTC.*

*There are other exchanges like Binance (king), Reserve and AirTM (and many more), but they don't make public their stats. So I use LocalBitcoin as gauge.*

*Inflation over 140% since January. Which is good for us compared for what we had before.*

*Yes, monthly minimum wage is under 14 USD. It's 130 Bs. (Bolivares) monthly and the exchange rate is 9.3 Bs per USD.*

2. Send your BTC balance there. There is literally only 2 buttons on the whole app. Send and Receive. Can’t mess it up. 

3. Go to Trezor and buy model one ($67) or Model T ($213). Both are open source and pretty comparable. I bought my dad the T since, it’s just slightly better Usability. It will take a week or so to come in. That would be okay, since your funds is safe at Muun or whatever hot wallet you downloaded. 

4. Take a look at the various metal plates here: https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/ and get one to save your 12 words when your Trezor comes 

5. Once your Trezor comes, play with it. Pretend it gets lost in a boating accident and you need to recover it. Then, slowly move your balance from your hot wallet there as you get more comfortable.

6. You should have your steel plate and 12 words around now. Keep it safe and treat it as a gold bar that is digital. you can memorize the words, have a billion dollar in it, travel with it. Give some of it to someone across the globe.

9678,1668371886,False,"Satoshi created bitcoin to address two main problems:
1. You can’t trust the one who issue your money (in the case of governments printing their own currency into hyperinflation)
2. You can’t trust the one who keep your money (in the case of bank running fractional reserve lending out your money for questionable projects)

What we see in the last few days with FTX is an example of problem #2. Many people talk about this, saying this is why they can’t trust crypto. Few know that their own banks run fractional reserve as well. FTX is said to have 1 billion of reserve against 9 billion of liabilities (people’s money), the reserve ratio is 11.11%.

The legal required reserve ratio for banks in the UK is 12%, 10% for mortgage finance. For US banks, it used to be 3%, now it’s 0%. For Vietnam, it’s 3%. 

What 3% reserve mean in a simplified example: for every $1000 you keep in your bank, the bank is required to keep only $30 in reserve, they can lend out $970 to pocket profit, counting on the fact that not all people will withdraw money all at once. 

Sometimes, the money is lent to high leverage projects, with low standards, leading to more money printing or use of taxpayers money to bail out insolvent banks. (2008 financial crisis).

FTX kept about 11% of reserve and make reckless “investment” on users fund, counting on the hope that most users will keep their crypto on exchanges. Once there was a bank run where many people withdraw at once, they were toasted.

Do you know what your bank reserve % is? Is it better/worse than FTX a month ago?

The reason was, my interpretation to “Not your Keys, not your Coins” meant to me that Coinbase could block my account and deny me from reaching my coins. And personally the risk of having my coins on me was higher than on Coinbase. So I left them there. 

What I recently learned that this term was not explained well enough to me to understand what exchanges were doing, and if I did, I would have weighed the risk much differently. 

Apparently, exchanges were playing the old banks game of selling IOUs, when they don’t even HAVE the coins. Not that my coins are with them and I might be blocked. No, there was no coins to begin with. They were basically “printing” Bitcoins. That was a sudden realization to me. I didn’t know I was buying IOUs. I thought I was buying Bitcoin.

Me not pulling my coins after buying them only helped them play this game even more. And I was part of the problem just as they. 

Now I’m thinking, how did selling IOUs effect the real price/value of Bitcoin. If they were/still are “printing” Bitcoin. They must have affected the price greatly. 

I now also understand the need for regulation. It’s more about regulating this aspect, more than anything else. Unfortunately, most of the regulation we have now is on the buyers side. With ID verification and taxes. We need regulation on exchanges to ensure they are selling something they actually own. 

I want to add one small detail, Coinbase might technically be in a better position than other privately owned exchanges. But still. I wouldn’t make the same mistake even with them.

9765,1668399984,False,"First off, I am sorry for anyone who is suffering because of the recent events. What has happened to you is unfair, illegal and...avoidable.

Let these events serve as a reminder. A reminder of why Bitcoin was created in the first place. Born out of the financial crisis in 2009, Satoshi gifted us with something never before known to man - Incorruptible, portable, censorship resistant, open, permissionless, trustless, verifiable, unforgeable, digital hard money. 

*A way out.*

Bitcoin gives you something you can *truly* own. Property rights that nobody can take from you or modify the terms of. ***You can choose*** to store generational wealth in your head with just 12 words. ***You can choose*** for your wealth to die with you, *impossible* to recover. 

So then, how did someone steal your Bitcoin? Isn't Bitcoin supposed to fix this?

If you lost Bitcoin in the recent exchange collapses, it is because ***you chose*** to have your Bitcoin there. **That is** ***the uncomfortable truth***, and I know it sucks. But let this be a lesson in ***choices***. Bitcoin gives you the inalienable ability to ***choose*** who you trust with your wealth. Next time ***choose*** yourself. 

Take control of your Bitcoin. Take responsibility for it. Take ownership of it. That is where the magic is, and it is what makes Bitcoin special. Don't be tricked into giving those things away to smooth talking charlatans, who promise to make you rich, then steal from you. Opt out.  


&gt;If we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one.

Having an EULA that says, ""We own your crypto if it is on our exchange. You do not own your crypto if it is on our exchange."" is not good enough. I have a better suggestion.                

The general idea: Regardless of the exchange, if you have a sum of crypto that is above the minimum withdrawal limits on the exchange, then the exchange is obligated to give you a notification when you log-in. This notification **is required to be displayed on screen for 10 seconds. The user cannot close the notification for 10 seconds.** The notification will clearly display a message that says, ""You have a significant amount of crypto-assets on our exchange. If you do not withdraw these crypto-assets to your own wallet off, then you do not actually own these crypto-assets, and they may be susceptible to theft by nefarious actors.  We may or may not be held responsible for theft of your crypto-assets depending on where you live. Please read more information here (insert link) about how you can safely store your crypto assets and click here (insert link) to see examples of previous incidents where users lost funds held on cryptocurrency exchanges.""                 

The proposed notification above will appear not more than once every week upon user login and not less than 4 times every month a user logs in. The users of these exchanges then wouldn't have any excuses or logical legal recourse if they lose funds on such an exchange. Last but not least, I propose that this notification would appear if a user has an amount of cryptocurrency that is above the minimum withdrawal amount on a centralized exchange.","This might be the best solution to the ""Not Your Keys, Not your Bitcoin"" issue + trust in exchanges issue and it may actually stop the need for additional regulation.

In addition, I almost jumped off my plan again, because I did not see the forest for the trees.  
Therefore an experience report.  


I also joined recently, for me it was very difficult at the beginning because each exchange (trader side) itself has the feeling that he is the best.   
After a lot of back and forth I decided to go with Kraken, simply because the live support is very accommodating and always available. The fees are also okay for me.

I have also created an account with Etoro and Binance. 

At Etoro I have the attempt of copytrading, of course with S/L (sells as soon as a selected loss or profit is pending). Whether that becomes something, who knows. Since everyone must also decide for themselves whether he has lust for it. Would also be a separate topic.

For storage I have bought a Ledger Nano S. Especially now with the recently known FTX scandal certainly a good idea.  
With the cold wallets, I read the rule that it is worthwhile as soon as you have more value in coins than the wallet costs.

Finally, I would like to say that I am not an expert. Therefore also this contribution. Maybe there are also better faster ways with less fees who knows.

Let me start off by saying gold is super rare, very hard to mine / find, and very expensive people who own lots of gold typically have lots of wealth. BUT, There are several other elements that are many times more rare than gold. Take IRIDIUM for example cheap but very very very rare. 

 My point to all this is gold's real world utility is about 0. The only thing gold is really good for is coating electrical connections.  Imagine a time in the future when gold is the currency used could you imagine toting around tons of gold chiseling off little bits and pieces as you need them testing them for purity and proving what you have is real gold and then the change that you get would have to be tested and weighed.

 To me gold is just a pretty peice of metal.  And with the price being what it is unrealistic to use as a currency.

I'm vaguely familiar with how this works, but have doubts with my small amount of experience.

I was going to send some BTC from Gemini to my Ledger. I put the amount in to send, and Gemini is showing a Receiving address name that I must have put in as a pre-approved whitelist address a while back because the name looks like something I would have wrote. However, I wanted to verify that the actual bc1 address shown is a sub address of my xpub so I can verify that I am sending it to my Ledger and not somewhere else.

I searched around the web and here on reddit and nothing I read showed me how to do this. When I went to some of the recommended sites and entered my xpub address from Ledger, I could not see a sub address that matches what I see in Gemini, so I think I might be doing this wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Q2. People say you have to generate a new receive address from Ledger for every receiving transaction, however the exchanges set your whitelist address as the one to always use. So, in order to send to a new address every time from exchange to ledger, that means I have to go through the whitelist address verification process every time, are people actually doing that? Or, when they say use a new receive address every time, they mean every time with a different exchange. So, each different exchange would have the one address saved, but it would be different for each exchange, but for each exchange, the whitelist address would stay the same?",How to verify receiving address on exchange is a sub address of my xpub address?,0.81

Currently, I store all of my bitcoin on a DeFi wallet, and I keep my keys on a physical piece of paper. I like this for two reasons:
1. It's very seamless to move coins from CEX to DeFi, and vice versa (if I need to sell for any reason)
2. I can engage some of my coins in DeFi protocols to earn more BTC (Yes, I understand the risks with DeFi protocols in general).

It seems like this sub is extremely pro cold wallet, which I get, but I'm curious if a DeFi wallet offers similar security to a cold wallet. I have my own keys. Thanks all!",Hot vs Cold Storage,0.75

The good news is, the fees for withdrawal to my local currency is close to $0 so i guess i'll be withdrawing all my funds instead.

Does it impact the nature of futures with regards to price discovery? I don't quite understand the idea of ""Funding Rates"" and payouts and how this affects the spot market.

The amount of leverage allowed on these derivatives is frightening (Binance allows 125x leverage), but it doesn't appear that these can be traded in the US?

Are perpetual futures purely a crypto or defi invention? Or is it something that is normal or common outside the USA in more traditional futures markets (commodities, etc).

I'm looking into this while waiting 10 days for my ACH payments to ""settle"" on Binance so I can remove my coins to cold storage :P",Perpetual futures contracts and Exchanges,1.0

This allows for communication with your companion wallet app (e.g. BlueWallet) using QR codes to receive and send bitcoin, instead of connecting via USB or Bluetooth. Air-gapped transactions can increase the security of your wallet, as you have physical control over when your device receives and sends data instead of being constantly connected like many hardware wallets.

Jade can also now work very similarly to a SeedSigner, by allowing temporary access to a wallet by scanning a SeedQR and forgetting the wallet from your device as soon as you are done using it.

Check out a demo of Jade performing an air-gapped transaction with BlueWallet here: https://twitter.com/blockstream/status/1591831525418573824?s=46&amp;t=l3ocYJuvDfuOJdg2OqYoHA",Fully air-gapped transactions activated with Blockstream Jade’s camera,0.87

I was explaining to my parents that they should get  a hardware wallet to purchase and self custody.  I didn't want to just tell them exactly what to do, I wanted them to feel like they understood. So when they asked what to get, I started walking them through it.

First, choose a wallet that is bip39 compatible.  I got my first ""are you serious?"" look.  But we got past that.  They said, ""ok, so if the wallet is industry standard, then if that wallet breaks and I get another one, I just enter those seed words and I'm fine?""

Hmmm... not exactly.  The new wallet will have to have the same derivation path, or you might not have access to the same addresses.  So I told them to just buy the same wallet.  They asked, what if that one goes out of business? Or if the government bans them and they can't get another HW.  I said, just get a software wallet on your phone.

But then, I started thinking, would that support bip39 with the same derivation path?  

I realized I need to do more research.  And I've owned bitcoin for over a decade...  

My parents were not interested in researching, they just wanted to be done with the conversation.  Everyone buys bitcoin at the price they deserve.  Apparently my parents deserve a future price...

The community really needs to come together and agree on some consistent rules (that will maintain backwards compatibility everywhere) that everyone can feel comfortable with.

From a brief search, I don't even think the bitcoin core software would support importing a ledger or trezor backup mnemonic.

Until the bitcoin ecosystem matures, bitcoin is great for techies and people willing to put in the effort to learn, but lazy speculators are going to continue to get wrecked on centralized exchanges and average people are going to continue to just read about it in the paper.

Edit:  while I was posting this, another user was commenting:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ywqzyz/comment/iwkxrdk/

Confusion about compatibility of seeds between software wallets.  Kind of reinforces my point.

Edit2: While responding to another user, I noticed that BIP39, which most hardware wallets are basing their mnemonic deterministic keys on, has a status of ""Proposed"".

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips

Some other statuses are Rejected, Replaced, Withdrawn, Deferred, or Obsolete.  Until the status of the BIP that your mnemonic key is based on is ""Final"", how confident can we really be that this will be supported long-term?

10369,1668622714,False,"Hi there,

as the title says, I would like to know some things.. We recently discussed with friends about how it works and even in 3 people we couldn't find answers on some things. Maybe I'm just not good enough in Googling, but I have already browsed Quora, Reddit, some articles, watched some videos and they usually repeat the same things, but usually it is just only surface of how it works or rather what it is.. I even read one book about Bitcoin, but still.. So if you could clarify me a few questions or even some related info would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Every 10 minutes there is a new block, which is created by miners, right? I wonder whether all the transactions on the network must wait until a new block is created to be processed?
2. This follows up the first question... Why when someone pay bigger fee have faster transaction than someone who pay basic fee? There is some limit how many transcations can be processed with one block and you basically compete with your fee against others transcations about priority? So with some big fee transaction will be processed in the next block and with basic fee, it will be processed in like 4th block?
3. About how mining works.. What determines winner of reward from block.. I read, the first one who will get hash with certain count of zeros in the beginning of hash will win, but does it matters what the rest of hash looks like? Like if **0000kxASDKJ** and **0000JKJDMsa** can be both winners (sorry for pseudoformat)? Is that winning hash about zeros in the beginning or you must get something more specific?
4. There is also some thing called difficulty regarding mining. More mining power = bigger difficulty. What makes it more difficult? Requirement of more zeros on the beginning of hash? Like when I want to get more difficulty, I as the network won't require **0000jADSn** but **000000maFLEW**, because there is lesser likely to guess this hash? Also, why it should be more difficult in the first place?
5. There are various rewards for each block. Why? It is determined by count of transactions or by sum of the fees paid on transactions? Although as a pool miner I really didn't care about this, it is important for solo miners, but still wondering.
6. Is there just one blockchain of BTC (not counting some BTC forks), where are all the new blocks are added and all the historic transactions can be found be there?
7. When I own some BTC I should have a private key and I'm authorized to make transactions with certain amount, but where is the amount stored? In the blockchain or in some specific block? And if I have accumulated more BTC in several years, it must be quite mess if should be stored something in one block, something in another block. Do I still have just one private key and it is somehow linked among the blocks?

&amp;#x200B;

That's everything so far I recalled. Maybe some more questions will pop up yet.

On the one hand, this makes some sense to me. You are essentially paying 2% per year to Grayscale to keep the keys safe on your bitcoin. It's also unlikely ever to make a disbursement. So, if you bought it and held it forever, the value of bitcoin would need to increase by more than 2% per year for it to be a stable investment.

On the other hand, you can absorb a lot of 2% fees before the 35% discount makes much sense. I was also looking over its 10Q and it appears to actually own the bitcoin, storing the bitcoin on Coinbase, which is decently reputable.

What SBF's law professor dad is probably reading right now:

*THEFT, EMBEZZLEMENT, RECEIPT OF STOLEN PROPERTY, PROPERTY DESTRUCTION, AND OFFENSES INVOLVING FRAUD OR DECEIT*

*If the loss exceeded $6,500, increase the offense level as follows...*

One of the most difficult concepts for people to understand is that, other than knowledge, you do not own anything in the legacy financial system. Seeking fiat wealth is completely pointless and just reinforces the current violence-based system.

Real estate is taxed and can be confiscated. Values can be manipulated by governments and speculators. If war breaks out where you live, you can't take it with you. Same goes for durable goods and precious metals.

***""bUt I hAvE a 401k!!!""***

Stocks, bonds, savings aren't real. Unless you direct register (aka self-custody) your stock shares, you own an IOU. Even then, your accounts can be frozen on a whim of a tyrannical government, or taxed into oblivion. Fiat savings are designed to lose value over time due to inflation and money printing. This whole system is built on lies and the house always wins.

Altcoins are just get rich quick schemes by those looking to fool people who are late(r) to the bitcoin party and have regrets. Hint, there can be an infinite number of altcoins but there will only ever be one bitcoin.

The list goes on. 

Bitcoin on the other hand, when properly self-custodied (NOT on exchanges), is ***yours***. 

It cannot be censored or confiscated (again if properly self-custodied). You can take it with you anywhere in the world when your government fails you. 

It is the first asset (again, other than knowledge), that you can truly own. It represents such a radically different way of thinking that it will take many many years for people to fully understand its implications.

Until then, the corrupt legacy financial system will do everything to try and stop it. Altcoins, futures, negative media, regulations, taxes, etc, will all continue to be deployed against it. The good news is that none of it will work. No one can make more bitcoin. No one can take yours away. All ""they"" can control is the fiat price. Humanity wins when price stops being the end point we collectively seek.

* Once all bitcoins are mined (estimated in 100+ years from now in [~2140](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-happens-when-all-21-million-bitcoin-are-mined)) the miners will only get paid in transaction fees
* The transaction fee historically make up about [5% of the block][](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/stats/fees-percent-of-reward/) reward, but have huge variation (historic max of &gt;75%)
* Bitcoin network security (as measured in TH/s) is currently at/near ATHs of [262M TH/s](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate).

Assuming the capital/operational expenditure in 2022 dollar terms remains static forever (i.e. we might get much higher TH/s, but only due to cheaper energy, better asics etc), does this mean that to maintain a relatively high level of security we need the number of transactions on the network to increase by 20x by 2140. 

Note: I arrive at 20x because this is the increase in the number of transactions (1/5%) that you would need to pay a block miner on average to reach parity with the returns that the bitcoin block reward emission currently/historically provided.

Need your opinions on the following questions about crypto wallets:

1. When using your current crypto wallet, which step do you think is the pain in the ass? The gas, the seed phrases, or anything else?
2. What made you use a hot wallet for the first time? Is it for a certain project, or just for security concerns?
3. If your friend(new to crypto) asks for your recommendation on hot wallets, which one would you recommend and why? Is the answer still the same if your friend is not new to crypto?
4. What functions do you think would be cool to have in a crypto wallet?

During this bear market, there is nothing better than spending more time understanding the tech behind BTC :)

I am struggling to understand something and I was hoping one of you could help me out!

Lets say I have a single sig wallet connected to my trezor. 

If I then go ahead and use that same Trezor along side a Cold Card and a ledger device to create a 2 of 3 Multisig wallet, would I still be able to use the Trezor for the Single Sig wallet I previously had?  Or would I have to have two sets of private keys for the Trezor , one for the single sig wallet and a new set for the multi sig wallet? 

Basically If I currently have X amount of BTC on my single sig trezor connected wallet will I be able to use that Trezor to sign the transaction in order to send that amount to the newly created multisig wallet? 

I hope I have managed to explain myself well :P",MultiSig Cold Wallet Question,1.0

10754,1668768882,False," The US currently has a debt to GDP ratio of around 130%. Historically, the risk of default if debt to GDP of a country is above 100% is 98%.

That means the US has a 98% probability of default.

There are two roads to default.

A) Official default. If that happens the global financial system would collapse. In such a case you absolutely want to hold portable, hard to confiscate assets with no counterparty risk. Road A leads to Bitcoin.

B) Unofficial default, a smarter road to default. In this case the Fed and other central bankers suppress interest rates below the rate of inflation while debasing their currency. This is also called financial repression. In this case bond holders/creditors never get their original investment back(after adjusting for inflation) even though the US did officially not default on their debt. The US will likely choose this option.

In that case you don't want to hold fiat yield farm coins(government bonds) while the Fed dumps USD on you Terra-Luna style (their size really is size).

Don't forget that Terra had to print always more of their coin to support their yield product UST. In this case the US dollar is Luna and government bonds are UST, the unsustainable yield product.

1 USD will always be 1 USD so it can't lose it's peg unlike UST but it will lose it's peg against all other goods when the government has to print like crazy to continue to pay out yields to USD debt investors. The dollar will be sacrificed like Luna to support the government's yield product but investors will still lose a lot of their money after adjusting for monetary inflation.

Boomer governance tokens (stonks) might be a much better option but they are already overvalued and if there is sustained high monetary debasement the economy will hurt and so will stock earnings.

What you want in that case is an asset that can't be debased and that is not a fiat derivative. Road B also leads to orange coin.

Alternatively, the unproductive yellow rock that needs a bigger fool buyer (gold) also looks attractive but if it does really well our digital tulip banker poison² coin would likely do much better.

Central bankers will of course hope that people hold on to their fiat bags as the bag holders help undo the mess they have created losing their personal savings. That's why they will want to convince people that gold is a terrible investment and bitcoin is going to zero while they gradually devalue the dollar towards zero.

They will also want to convince people that all problems are socio-economic, geopolitical or whatever but never due to monetary policy itself.

Many will fall for it because government bonds are presumably risk-free and some entities will have no choice as they will be required to hold bonds in their funds or on their balance sheet.",Why all roads lead to Bitcoin and why fiat yield farm investors will be exit liquidity for central bankers and the Fed,0.89

10799,1668780321,False,"**What is Stackchain?**

Simply put, Stackchain is the gamification of buying bitcoin.

Stackchain was born completely organically when AriZonanHODL decided to buy $5 of bitcoin and see if anyone else wanted to buy a little with him. Someone replied with a $6 purchase. Next, someone replied to that $6 purchase with a $7 purchase. Then, someone replied to that purchase with an $8 purchase. These consecutive purchases kept coming in, iterating one after another, growing the chain of purchases, expanding the amount of bitcoin that was being purchased. Eventually, many bitcoin plebs fell in love with the idea of stacking bitcoin consecutively with one another, growing their stack, acquiring more bitcoin, all the while growing the chain of posts on the original Twitter thread. And thus, Stackchain was born.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Even on days when I'm broke as hell I still stack. Feel free to join me.""

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past four months, Stackchain's growth has been truly remarkable, operating with social consensus and the gamification of buying bitcoin. Through this, over 500 Stackchainers have purchased over 2.8 million dollars worth of bitcoin and over 130 BTC.

Stackchain has raised funds for Bitcoin communities around the world from Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, to Bitcoin Island in Philippines, to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala, to Bitcoin Ekasi in South Africa, to raising funds to help defend Bitcoin from scammers like CSW.

Stackchain hasn't stopped there either. Besides stacking bitcoin for themselves and others around the world, Stackchainers have stacked Bitcoin and Lightning nodes, building nodes, running nodes, and build 5 Rings of Fire for the Lightning network.

Stackchainers recently attended Pacific Bitcoin in Santa Monica, CA. There, Stackchainers organized and led a hackathon to build a Stackchain application to make Stackjoins and Mempool management more user friendly, sustainable, and more inclusive. Stackchainers participated on a panel at the Swan Dome Stage, discussing all things Stackchain.

**Cory Klippsten of Swan said that Stackchain was the most exciting thing happening in Bitcoin right now.** 

If fact, if you use Swan to buy bitcoin, you can do a #Stackjoin directly from the Swan app! [Stackchain](https://www.stackchainsignal.com) is also in talks with two other bitcoin only exchanges and hopes to bring about additional functionality next year.

If you'd like to get started with Stackchain, we have various guides and FAQs on our website. There you can learn how to do a Stackjoin or find the tip and buy a full block. (Please note that some of this functionality will be changing in the near future as we finish the development of our application.)

**Don't use Twitter? Prefer Reddit? NO PROBLEM!**

Let's start a Reddit Stackjoin Chain right here. All you have to do is buy the next amount. If you don't have USD, just buy the equivalent amount in your local currency. The goal of this Stackjoin chain will be to build a block on the main chain on Twitter. (For example: if the current block height of Stackchain is [2385](https://twitter.com/BrokenSystem20/status/1593513728024125440), we'll need to stack amounts $5 through $69.","Stackchain, a flourishing bitcoin buying community, turns four months old today.

Ideally, of course, I'd like the lender to be unable to lend my collateral over to other parties or to spend it on anything else (mutisig with an arbitrator) ; but in the real world, here are the requirements:

Requirements:

1. not cut-throat interest rates
2. clear rules on margin calls, that allow for at least 24h  to add more collateral no matter how low the price drops
3. be decent (the most difficult part). In particular this means that their standing should not depend on the price of random  shitcoins.

   4. I'd like to avoid ""wrapped BTC"" and any exposure to shitcoins

Examples:

\- Blockfi has just flopped; apparently satisfied 1 and maybe 2 (subject to negotiations?) but not 3.

\- SALT has just flopped;  I don't know what conditions they had, but clearly failed on 3.

\- Ledn has not flopped (yet). They had a very high dependence on Genesis capital which has died recently, but they managed to disentangle themselves fast enough. I'm not sure they satisfy 3.

\- Kraken  I'd say is decent enough (of course one can't never be sure), but their interest rates compound to like 40% per year, so not suitable for my purposes (may be fine for a day trader but not for a long-term loan).

Bitcoin fixes this. It separates money from the state and takes away the power from banks and politicians. It is designed in such a way that it can last for centuries and resist all sort of attacks. There is no single entity or group of people that controls it. The monetary policy cannot be messed with.

Altcoins (shitcoins) are an attack on Bitcoin because they distract people from the main goal, which is to replace the fiat monetary system. Their narratives rely on attacking Bitcoin (""it's old tech"", ""too slow"", ""has no utility"", ""bad for the environment""), slowing down its overall adoption. 

Most of these altcoins **1)** are scams that exist to enrich its creators, **2)** are centralized (their rules can be easily changed), **3)** solve no real world problems and **4)** are being used exclusively for trading as a way to earn more fiat. The entire industry is full of scams and endless promises.

The discovery/invention of Bitcoin cannot be replicated. It solves a problem that took humans thousands of years to solve: Scarce money that cannot be diluted or manipulated by anyone.

Altcoins are infinite. There are more than 20,000 altcoins and new ones are being created every day. There is no end to this. They do nothing more than suck up demand from Bitcoin and give the whole space a bad reputation.

why are people still so anti-bitcoin? Eg.

10981,1668868886,False,"I'm sitting on some decent cash and about to toss it into BTC and move it off the exchange. I'm curious what you fine folks think on the current state of things. BTC has been fairly sideways for a few weeks. Holding up at $16k fairly strong even after the FTX fiasco. There are things everywhere saying a few other exchanges may be in trouble as well and are trying to hide it. If there is a cascading event that takes down more exchanges could we see lower levels of BTC, say around 12-13k? The difference in buying in now vs these ""potential"" lower levels for what I'm putting in would be a difference of about .6 BTC. So some pretty big opportunity cost long term if it does dip further. I know many people said we'd never see this current price of BTC again and here we are. I feel as though the risk of missing out on upward momentum from our current levels is greater than potentially falling lower, since other exchanges failing is likely somewhat priced in already.

Within the crypto portfolio, I stayed mostly in Bitcoin over that time, currently approximately 2/3 BTC. My only other crypto holding (which is not ETH) and Bitcoin are performing similarly well in my portfolio. But dividend paying stocks have also done well, so let's compare. The average return for a DCA into a good dividend paying stock I own over the same time period yielded a 36.4% return vs. today's price including dividends plus appreciation, whereas my crypto portfolio acquired over the same time span yielded 73.1% vs. today's prices.

I decided to write an article ([https://www.informedinterest.com/](https://www.informedinterest.com/)) on Bitcoin as I think its good to remind ourselves of what it all started with in times like these. I'll be debunking some common misconceptions. Enjoy and let me know in the comments what you think! :)

**Bitcoin is Scarce**  
Many of Bitcoin’s proponents claim it to be a hedge against inflation which, if true, would make it an extremely relevant investment today. With inflation being at its highest point in 40 year, obtaining real positive returns becomes increasingly difficult. There is, however, no evidence that Bitcoin is correlated with inflation. It is true that fiat currencies such as the US dollar and Euro have lost value due to inflation since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, whereas Bitcoin’s value (expressed in these currencies) has gone up significantly. So has the price of Amazon stock. So has real estate. A smart reader will note that almost anything has increased in value since Bitcoin’s launch. It happened to coincide with the bottom of the bear market caused by the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.

Even so, Bitcoin is often praised as a better alternative to fiat currencies with regards to inflation. Another common misconception is that this relates to Bitcoin’s fixed supply of only 21 million coins. The number of coins, however, is completely irrelevant. There could have been double/half the number of coins and one Bitcoin would roughly be worth half/twice of what it’s worth today. The fact that you can own the tiniest fraction of a Bitcoin renders this argument even less valid.

The real reason Bitcoin is considered ‘scarce’ is due to its supply rate, which is cut in half roughly every four years. It is therefore that Bitcoin’s supply rate was extremely high right after its launch but has significantly decreased ever since. This is illustrated by the image below which shows a predictable inflation rate that is approaching zero. This effect is equally captured by the blue dotted line, symbolizing all Bitcoins that have been mined already, which is asymptomatically approaching 21 million. These numbers come directly from the code of the Bitcoin protocol and can only be adjusted if more than half of the network agrees with it. Something that is extremely unlikely given the fact it would erase one of Bitcoin’s most valuable properties.

A decreasing and predictable supply makes Bitcoin a unique investment. Regardless of when you buy Bitcoin, the inflation rate will only decrease since the moment you made that purchase. Something that cannot be said of any government-backed currency.

**Bitcoin Does Not Produce Anything**  
I would like to address an often-heard counter argument as to why Bitcoin, despite the above, is not a good investment. It does not create anything. No dividends, no interest, no nothing. This distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional investments such as stocks and bonds, that generally do have some kind of cash flow. It is therefore harder to value which often leads to the conclusion that it has no value.

This is too short-sighted. Gold does not produce a cash flow. Neither does art or your Rolex. Yet these are often seen as valid investments. Not for their cash flow, but for their utility and (you guessed it) scarcity. Bitcoin has both qualities. It is scarce as it has an ever-decreasing issuance rate and capped supply. It has utility as it allows for value transfers from any place in the world to another, granted there is an internet connection. It is often cheaper to buy Bitcoin (or any crypto) and send it to a friend abroad for him or her to sell it for their local currency than to go through the traditional banking sector.

**Bitcoin is a Bubble**  
Bubbles are a unique phenomenon directly attributable to human nature. Humans are not rational. Just think about all the stupid things you have done in the past and how you wish you had made a rational rather than an emotional choice. I know I have. This absence of human ration in decision-making is also very pronounced in the investment world. So many biases lead us (even professional investors) to making mistake that could have been prevented.

One of these biases is called Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). We have all experienced it in our life. Probably as an insecure teenager, but likely still today when you hear your neighbor talk about how he tripled his money with some exotic investment. Most people will only hear about a certain investment when it has been given a lot of publicity, often after a sharp rise or decline in value. Not wanting to miss out, gains are being chased to the point where assets become overvalued. This leads to more publicity and the cycle repeats until the bubble bursts. Although we like to think we are smarter than our ancestors during the Tullip Mania or the South Sea Bubble, we are not. We still exhibit FOMO, overconfidence, and self-attribution bias as well as many others.

The graph below shows the relation between the numbers of Bitcoin users and its value over time. The graph only accounts for active adresses, a conservative figure of the actual number of users. The correlation is, not surprisingly, strong. The main reason for Bitcoin’s enormous growth over the last decade is an increasing number of users and this higher demand (with a decreasing supply) has led to a higher price. This increased adoption does not happen linearly but rather in waves. At the peak of these waves, bubble-like price behavior has occurred but that does not mean the entire price development has been a bubble.

**Bitcoin is Too Volatile**  
Too volatile for what? It is a simple fact that Bitcoin is more volatile than many other asset classes. This volatility has been coming down over the years as Bitcoin's market cap increases. It is, however, still significantly more volatile than basically all other major asset classes as the image below showcases. Is that a problem? Well it depends. For Bitcoin to be a currency that can be used for everyday spending, borrowing and saving, such as the US dollar or Euro, it is indeed too volatile. For transfers of value that would have been too expensive or extremely cumbersome through the traditional financial system, its volatility poses less of a problem. The main question, however, is whether its price swings renders it invalid to be a store of value. This all depends on whether you believe it to hold or increase its value over time. Short-term volatility is irrelevant if your investment horizon is a decade. If it is short-term profit that you are after, Bitcoin likely is not for you. Bitcoin is volatile, and although this volatility is expected to come down as its market cap increases, you should treat it as any other high-risk investment. Take a long-term approach and do not invest more than you can afford to lose and you will able to withstand its temper.

I've been at a crossroads recently and I don't know what to do or how to get back to where I was.
I've lost close to everything during the FTX scandal. I have only gotten into this whole scene to hopefully help my brother and mother get out of their misery, now I've been smacked into a wall it feels like. The months coming up already have me taking out the last funds that I have, so I don't know how to start back up again. If it is even possible to recover since I'll have to choose between payments so I'll be going late on a few. 

I know it wasn't smart to bet on one horse, but this seemed the only thing going positive for me. Now I've lost my faith and I'm too scared to start again.
If anyone knows how to go about this or has any tips. Please anything would be appreciated, I'm at my last draw.

Let's say I have 3 signing devices, a Trezor (a),  a Coldcard (b), and a Ledger (c). They each have been set up with a bip39 passphrase as well.

Would I be able to create multiple permutations of 2/3 multisig using the above signing devices?   
e.g.  `a &amp; b &amp; c` would be a different 2/3 from `a+passphrase &amp; c+passphrase &amp; c+passphrase`

11330,1669053276,False,"Hi Bitcoiners,  


I just wanted to shine light on the Grayscale situation.   
I've been following Barry around on the internet for around two years now and would just like to say, I think everyone is wrong about him.   


Barry is not your usual hedge fund manager that lasts half a cycle and then goes bust. He tweets in a very troll/cryptic manor. If you check back to his tweets where he says things like ""It's going to be a big week"", what he actually means is ""it's going to be a big wick"" (to the downside). If you followed Barry you would have made so much money shorting the bear market. His signals were amazing and knew exactly when to get in and out of positions and would tweet about them (in a troll way) before it happened.   


Twitter is scared of the current situation of grayscale and worried GS will end up liquidating positions and sending BTC to 3k again. I don't believe this is the case as he knew where the market was going in the first place. All Barry did was sell a product to a bunch of low IQ degen hedge funds (3AC) who went bust. That's not his problem. I'm also of the essence that he has a huge short position under the radar.  


Here is a [tweet](https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1526985078219452423) from back in May, which is actually a genuine tweet of him giving great advice. I think there is a huge misunderstanding here about grayscale and Barry. I personally don't expect a person of this calibre to go bust. In my humble opinion I think he is trolling everyone.   


Here are a few troll tweets from himself (just do the opposite):

Coinsquare claims that they hold assets 1:1 with client liability in cold storage, but their only way to prove it is by publishing their ""reserve"" on Nansen. However, this website doesn't mean shit! How do we know Coinsquare actually owns the addresses that are there? We don't know either how much they have in customer liabilities. Even if they happen to actually own the addresses on Nansen, they could still be running a fractional reserve.

I asked them today on Twitter why crypto withdrawals are down so often. Their response was: ""We detected unusual activity on our platform and had to turn off some processes as a safety measure."" UNUSUAL ACTIVITY... ehhhhhh very sus

Coinsquare is being extremely insistent on Twitter and via their email communications that the outages impacting their system are not related to liquidity issues and that they are a IIROC member firm. That doesn't mean shit also! FTX was also saying they had no liquidity issues, even though they were running a fractional reserve. Do you really think regulators are in the company's books every day looking if they are fully backed? Absolutely not.

Their issues started exactly after the FTX collapse. FTX bankruptcy filings shows that they have an estimated 1 million creditors. You don't think it's possible that Coinsquare had some exposure for market making purposes? Is it just a coincidence? Maybe... but likely not. Everything is intertwined in the crypto world.

Why is Coinsquare insisting that customer assets are safe but are never recommending customers to take ownership of their own keys? Shakepay (one of their biggest Canadian competitor) tweeted a long thread about self-custody on Nov 16th and actually recommends that their customers withdraw their bitcoin to a hardware wallet.

1) Storage. It's complicated. Don't hold your coins in an exchange, not your keys not your coins, etc. If the goal is world adoption, then I feel like the barrier of entry is pretty high. For people to safely store coins, they have to buy on a trusted exchange, then transfer them to a hardware wallet where they are difficult to spend when the user is ready. To many, this process is confusing and expensive. Is there something I'm missing here?

2) Loss of coins. There will only ever be 21 million coins. However, any user that is safely storing off an exchange risks total loss if they forget/lose their keys. That is a huge risk. Sure, less coins in circulation may increase the value of those that remain, but on a long enough timescale, all could be potentially lost.

If on-chain is a vault, and lightning is the wallet you walk around with, easy transition between the two modes without sacrificing the interconnected nature of the LN is critical. The loop feature that Lightning Labs has developed needs to be standardized and widely available to all, or at least a variant of it. I suspect that this vision of the future would have the bulk of on-chain activity being loop processing. 

One idea that I've been kicking around that I would like some feedback on is for lightning nodes to be able to both cooperatively close and open a lightning channel in a single transaction. The two parties would essentially be refreshing the channel, but more importantly one or both of them could have additional inputs to increase the size of the channel, or additional outputs for moving off the channel. This same functionality could allow a service provider that manages multiple nodes with well-connected channels to have an arbitrary number of single signer inputs sign funds into the refreshed channel and then routed back to them (a loop in), and multiple outputs that come from lightning payments to be sent back out (a loop out). The overall size of the channel then would have a net change of the amount looped in vs out. This should be possible to code without changing anything on-chain, merely an addition or change to the BOLT specification to allow for this kind of refresh.

11384,1669068196,False,"Unless you have been living under a rock, you've probably read some Forbes or other paid promo article that vilified El Salvador for making BTC legal tender and holding (or losing, depending what article you read) ~$50M in BTC during the recent bear market decent.

Just to be clear, if you believe ES is in bad shape from BTC in any shape or form, you've been duped by the banking elite and you should stop helping the elite taint BTC through propaganda. There are no opinions in here so downvote and hate all you want. Only proves my point further. 

First of all, El Salvador GDP skyrocketed over 10% annually to $28B recently after a massive influx of tourism, exporting volcano energy and other monetary gains last year. ES has not sold any BTC but let's just say for the sake of argument that they did and lost $50M outright, all 50 mil. 

$50M is literally only ~0.2% (edited for correct decimal) of their GDP. Lol Clearly this hypothetical loss would not affect the country in any way. Not to mention it is not true because ES hasn't sold anything and hasn't taken any losses whatsoever. 

Before Nayib Bukele became president, ES had $37B stolen from its people from corruptions and was pretty much the murder capital of the world. It was one of poorest and corrupt countries in exsistance.

Where was the out cry for the people then??? Where are the news articles about this bounce back from the low? Nowhere, because things wete going exactly as IMF is used to; theyre able to hold loans over their heads to have control over them etc. Only now that its a poster child for BTC is there backlash. Let that sink in. 

So now, violent crime is down 95%, revenue is up billions, and the country's presidential approval rating is close to 80% (what's your presidents approval rating in your country??).  Eighty percent!!! That's right. Ask someone who lives there if you don't believe the many many polls. There are no claims BTC is wholly responsible for all of the improvements, so don't get confused. 

Its just pretty ironic now (or not ironical at all if you think twice) that after all the murderous years of corruption and people suffering have turned into a huge approval from citizens that we have all these finacial ""experts"" calling this country to our attention to service their BTC agenda and literal propaganda campaign. It's ranked #1 in financial risk globally. Number one!!! That couldn't be more false and is really a blatant stat meant to do one thing, vilify BTC and the country that first adopted it. 

BTW, these numbers are all public and accessible if you have any doubts. 

So, the next time someone tries to tell you BTC caused harm in El Salvador, understand that PROPAGANDA WORKS on people who are dumb enough to believe whatever makes them feel validated, but this could not be further from the truth. 

I don't support Nayib, and this isn't to call him a genius etc., as much as it is just to point out other's stupidity that spreads these completely false rumors. Rumors that can literally be shot to pieces by using simple, publicly accessible information. 

Research safely and mind the idiots who actually believe this shit.

B. Bitcoin cannot be called/used as a currency because of its volatility. He made the claim that a currency must have a stable value.

C. He repeatedly brought up the point that ""Young people are stupid...  they don't know enough to see a scam coming"" (Direct Quote)

D. A point used against Bitcoin was showing returns if you invested in November of 2021 until today, you would've lost 77% of your investment

Here are the latest developments and updates:

- SBF lent $1 billion to himself. Other employees embezzled millions too: Nishad Singh: $540m, Ryan Salame: $55m

- SBF has admitted that the ""ethics stuff"" was ""mostly a front.""

- The mess at collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX is worse than the one at Enron. This is according to the ex-Enron CEO who is the new FTX CEO: “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls.”

- Alameda, their hedge fund was EXEMPT from being liquidated when trading on FTX, the court filing shows

- FTX's 'holdings' of $5.5 billion of tokens are now valued at just $659k

- FTX executives donated $72m to the democrats and republicans this election cycle before the mid-terms. Party was not an issue, they were trying to buy political influence

- One of the world's best investment firms Temasek has just wrote down their whole $275m investment in FTX. $210mn in FTX International and $65mm in FTX US

- Crypto broker Genesis Trading has halted withdrawals at lending unit, they have $175mn in funds stuck on FTX

- Crypto lender BlockFi is preparing for imminent bankruptcy, citing FTX collapse

This gets worse, every day that goes by and SBF is going straight to prison.

I was wondering if any of you had opened an SDIRA that gave you checkbook control, aka the option to buy and self custody BTC that is technically part of a rothIRA investment vehicle.

I've been looking at the options for a while, but the setup costs are very steep to have a custodian help you setup the required vehicles. So I'm mainly looking to see if individuas have setup a LLC or trust that falls under the right tax code to operate as a Roth IRA.

Jim Rogers, one of the best  investors of all time is interviewed.

The basic problem in the world today is that America is consuming more than it is saving. You need to do everything you can to encourage saving and investment: Eliminate taxation of savings, the capital gains tax, and dual taxation of dividends; bring back the more attractive incentives for IRAs, Keoghs, and 401Ks. At the same time, you need to do everything you can to discourage consumption. Change our tax structure to utilize a value added tax, which taxes consumption rather than saving and investing. Cut government spending dramatically—and there are lots of ways of doing it without hurting the economy too badly. We would have problems, but the problems would not be nearly as bad as when they are forced on us. If we don't bite the bullet, then we are going to have a 1930s-type collapse.

With the present cast of jerks in Washington, it is not going to happen. The politicians are going to foul things up. They are not going to do what has to be done. They are going to be more concerned about keeping their votes and winning the next election. That is going to continue until we are forced into solving our problems. Then it is going to be a disaster.

Initially, the politicians will say, ""We've got to bite the bullet and suffer through this. This is good for us; it will help clean out our system."" People are going to buy that for a while. Then it is going to start to hurt. Then it is really going to start to hurt. At that point, the politicians are going to give up, and they are going to start to inflate their way out of it. But the only way to inflate your way out at that point is to really print money! The dollar could eventually become like the Argentine peso.

FTX was setup from the beginning as a dark money political slush-fund. This scheme always had an exit strategy but it was supposed to be years if not decades down the road before they would need to exit. They knew there was always a chance someone would start to figure out what was going on but no one suspected this. 

They were going to use FTX to fund everything they could to permanently take control of the US government over the next 5 years. Think of the midterms as a trial run of this setup at 50%. SBF funneled 40 million into the midterms making him the second largest Democrat donator behind George Soros. It's very likely that 40M was FTXs customer funds or laundered money but it’s safe to say at the very least it was not SBFs money. The reason it seems like everyone is caught with pants down, hoping if they hold still no one will notice, is because they honestly don’t know what to do. They are exposed so badly, that for now the safest thing to do is nothing. 

Sam knew from the beginning it was all fake and no matter how much success or fame he gained from FTX that his fate would ultimately end with the events we saw the other day. I can only speculate on this part but I think as time went on he really believed that if it weren’t for those who orchestrated everything that he would be a successful CEO of an exchange like FTX. Over time he started to believe his actions were why FTX was at the top of the world and he resented the fact he would never get credit for it. Resentment grew and he accelerated the process by taking actions he wasn’t supposed to which led to the end of FTX. 

To be clear, I am saying the Democrats and other powerful political entities set up FTX with the intention of using it to fund whatever they needed to expand their reach and stay in power. They were going to continue operating as long as possible and they had a plan b that they saw as a win-win. The exit strategy all along was to blow up FTX in such a fashion that the SEC would have what it needed to force regulation of the crypto space. It would also help cover their tracks of their political operations. 

The large media companies were also involved in running cover for this operation. I’m not sure how much they knew about what was really going on but I suspect they didn’t know much. They have operated essentially as a wing of the democrat party for years now and are likely comfortable doing this sort of thing without knowing why.  This is likely why they weren’t worried about overselling SMB and FTX to an absurd degree. They likely wouldn’t have been so obvious about it if they known what they were involved in covering up.

After the last year lots of bad events happened and influenced the bitcoin market, but in this period of time mining a bitcoing has become more and more difficult. That means that the miners have more expenses and are forced to sell they're btc ( it is unlikely to be granted a loan in this market situation). 

This, they say, creates a negative spiral between bitcoin price and miners profitability. 

The risk is their massive capitulation; if many miners, as is already happening, declared bankruptcy simultaneously, it would become much easier to get 51% of the network’s computing power and compromise its security.

11592,1669154882,False,"Its interesting to keep an eye on Quantum computing so I thought to make a break down of what interesting from the [IBM quantum state of the union 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZu5hutqANk&amp;ab_channel=IBMResearch)

Quick rundown of why is this interesting regarding bitcoin:

1. One of the hearts of bitcoin is the sha-256 hashing algorithm. This cannot be cracked by classical computers even if Moors law stays in effect. However for a quantum computer which have - and is able to utilize - a single CPU with \~1.9 billion logical qubits (so about 8-12+ times that in physical), this becomes trivial. 
2. Once this, if ever, happens its not just that bitcoin is fucked, but everything else you can image in the digital world is also fucked (in fact, waaaay more fucked since the attack vector is probably a lot broader). For this reason there are already exists a [suit of cryptographic](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=cryptography-crystals-kyber-algorithm) solutions to switch to. There are two problems though. One is that the resulting hash is 4+ times larger then sha-256. The other is that they obviously cannot be stress tested until we have such a machine. 

**So where we are at?**

IBM just introduced they new Osprey Quantum CPU with a whooping 433 physical qubits! Depending on how much error correction you are shooting for that's about 36-52 logical qubits. The thing is the size of a frying pan, you need to cool it with a proprietary, hand built system the size of a freezer room. 

To use it, you have to break down your very specific problem into parts, where some of it can be fed to the Quantum computer, the rest have to be done by classical computers. For our sha-256 example it would need classical computers for orchestration and a shitton of ASIC-s for hash generation as well. 

**Why is this tech so slow?**

First off, watch the video. Even if the techno bla-bla goes over your head, the general feeling of complexity wont. 

1. [Because it doesn't work on room temperature](https://youtu.be/nZu5hutqANk?t=2085). To make the quantum processes even possible, you have to cool shit to near absolute zero. Then you need to get rid of all the heat that process generates. Its the same problem as a btc-miner just cranked up to eleven, if you cool on one end it has to heat up on the other end. The infrastructure to do this is brutal. Both in size and energy consumption. Right now they work on huge car-sized fridges to cool the entire computer section instead of individual cpu-s.
2. [Then we have error correction](https://youtu.be/nZu5hutqANk?t=737). Quantum computers are different from classical ones. Really stupid example: Instead of one and zero, you have a ""curve"" of probability of state for each qubit. You use more then one qubits (8-12) for the same state to have a solid idea what it represents, the more you use the better idea you have, but some room for ""error"" always remains. Now qubits, just like transistors, work in combinations to represent something of value. For example the decimal number 13 is four transistors flipped to 1 1 0 1 in combination. You can also ""flip"" 4 qubits to do something but those little remaining error possibilities accumulate. Exponentially. They try to mitigate this with using classical computers but the problem remains: You have a linear growth trajectory of number of possible qubits in the system, combined with an exponentially growing error correction need.

**So the thing where they break sha-256 in 10 years?**

Yeah... unless some earth shattering innovation happens, its a Nope. If you watch it, its clear they are already planning to make this into a multi-processor, modular system, for solving smaller, low qubit requirement problems in tandem with classical computers. Exactly because just increasing the qubits on one CPU is physically prohibitive. I find it hard to image that this tech is going to ""sneak up"" on anyone regarding cryptography. If they are able to double the single CPU qubits every year (which it seems are not even planned after Condor) they would get to the theoretically required 19 billion physical qubits by around \~2047.

Apologies for the long post, but I'm just doing some thought experiments and this was one of them. I don't have enough knowledge about the mining side of BTC to go through with this, but my question is pretty much the title and I'd like to see what others think and hopefully some reasonings on why this isn't an issue.

Below are some assumptions behind the reasoning of this thought. I understand the chances are incredibly low for all of  these things happening, but I'm still curious to know and I think it would be a good discussion. I'm also aware of the difficulty adjustment, per point 4, but bear with me. So, I'm assuming:

1. BTC price stays low/suppressed
2. Miners get priced out due to unprofitability
3. A lot (and I mean a lot) of miners stop mining within a short time horizon to prevent further losses (i.e. multiple large mining pools stop mining)
4. So much so that there are far too many blocks until the next difficulty adjustment
5. Now there are a fraction of the miners left on the network tasked with solving blocks, but the hash rate has been reduced heavily, resulting in a disproportioned difficulty level to hash rate
6. Blocks are then solved incredibly slowly and require a heavy amount of energy input and cost to solve, still resulting in a potential loss (even if we assume miners would receive a higher subsidy)
   1. Said another way, I'm assuming that although less miners would be entitled to more of the block rewards (aka would make it more profitable for them), this increase in rewards is offset by the large increase in cost to solve the block, removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss position

This then leads me to a few question:

1. What the title is asking
2. Is the mining difficulty adjustment calculation weighted more towards the near term and would it help solve this issue (after slowly solving the remaining blocks well above the desired average 10 minute blocktime)?
   1. I'd appreciate any good resources on learning about the difficulty adjustment
3. Can something like this be mitigated?
4. Is it crucially important for the average block to be solved every 10 minutes? What happens if became one block per hour or worse than that?
   1. I would think this is important as it helps preserve the security of the network and to keep the costs to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chain

That's the extent of my thoughts and questions. I'm no expert (probably clear to some of you haha), but wanted to ask anyway. Thanks!",Can Bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty gets too high and miners get priced out due to unprofitability (or some other cause)?,0.54

11662,1669177105,False,"A digital securities bill has been presented to El Salvador’s Congress, paving the way for the issuance of bitcoin-backed bonds. El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé submitted a digital assets issuance bill to the country’s legislative assembly, paving the way for the launch of its bitcoin-backed “volcano” bonds.

First announced one year ago today, the pioneering initiative seeks to attract capital and investors to El Salvador. It was revealed at the time the plans to issue $1 billion in bonds on the Liquid Network, a federated Bitcoin sidechain, with the proceedings of the bonds being split between a $500 million direct allocation to bitcoin and an investment of the same amount in building out energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure in the region.

A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to another blockchain, allowing for tokens from that blockchain to be used securely in the sidechain while abiding by a different set of rules, performance requirements, and security mechanisms. Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin that allows bitcoin to flow between the Liquid and Bitcoin networks with a two-way peg. A representation of bitcoin used in the Liquid network is referred to as L-BTC. Its verifiably equivalent amount of BTC is managed and secured by the network's members, called functionaries.
“Digital securities law will enable El Salvador to be the financial center of central and south America,” wrote Paolo Ardoino, CTO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, on Twitter.

Bitfinex is set to be granted a license in order to be able to process and list the bond issuance in El Salvador.

The bonds will pay a 6.5% yield and enable fast-tracked citizenship for investors. The government will share half the additional gains with investors as a Bitcoin Dividend once the original $500 million has been monetized. These dividends will be dispersed annually using Blockstream's asset management platform.

The act of submitting the bill, which was hinted at earlier this year, kickstarts the first major milestone before the bonds can see the light of day. The next is getting it approved, which is expected to happen before Christmas, a source close to President Nayib Bukele told Bitcoin Magazine. The bill was submitted on November 17 and presented to the country’s Congress today.

11685,1669192573,False,"Hello reddit,

When I was learning about bitcoin &amp; the technology behind its development. I thought the country which has the most powerful processors, gears to mine bitcoin will mine more bitcoins compared to other countries.

That led me into thinking that if this is the case then many countries will just be the ""bitcoin buyers"" if prices keep increasing.

To clarify my thoughts: For eg. USA has better tech than India. The miners of the USA can mine bitcoins faster than India's. And Bitcoins have fixed supply so price increases as demand increases. Now someone from India wants to buy bitcoin then he/she will get it from another country's miners. Here USA. And let's say at some point all the USA's bitcoin flows to India and the USA stops accepting bitcoin as a currency. That will be a huge loss for Indians. Here I have just taken two countries. But I am talking in general about slow mining countries vs fast mining countries.

Then I thought, ""title of this post"".

11753,1669221698,False,"Helloo [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/) 👋 My name is Aubrey Jesseau and I'm the founder of Beaver Bitcoin - a platform that allows Canadians to set up a weekly bitcoin buy directly from their bank account.

With permission from the mods I'd like to share some info about Beaver and what we do, as you probably haven't heard of us.

**-----**

**Background**

Like many of you, I first fell down the ""crypto"" rabbit hole before eventually understanding what Bitcoin offers the world. That was in 2016/17 and it took me a few years to come around, though once I understood Bitcoin I knew I wanted to do whatever I could to increase its adoption. At the time I was in between jobs but the only thing I could think about was Bitcoin. Eventually, the path became clear, and together with a good friend, and then another, we founded Beaver Bitcoin. Today, we've just pushed our first major update to the platform after receiving loads of valuable feedback on our first release. Even if you're not Canadian, I'd still love to hear your feedback, questions, comments and advice in the comments.

https://preview.redd.it/gg0wyzoaaq1a1.jpg?width=3808&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0373b181fd069d980ca492857e870ddc60454415

For a visual, this is our landing page. You can also poke around the live site at [beaverbitcoin.com](https://www.beaverbitcoin.com/).

With that, let's dive in.

**Goals**

Our main goal with Beaver Bitcoin is to make it easier for more Canadians to buy Bitcoin. Second to that, it's important we maintain Bitcoin's core value of self-custody. To accomplish these goals we do two things.

1. Fully-automate the entire buying process
2. Operate as a non-custodial platform

To set up a weekly buy with Beaver, all that's required is connecting a bank account, selecting a weekly buy amount in CAD $, and providing a wallet address for receiving your bitcoin. After that, you'll receive bitcoin to your wallet address every seven days.

I think this works and here's why. We are likely on the verge of another massive wave of bitcoin adoption, and when that wave hits, we have to ask, where are people going to go? The answer, as we know, is mostly exchanges. Even if it's non-custodial and bitcoin-only, exchanges themselves can be intimidating and appear complicated to many people. You've got buying and selling, market and limit orders, among other bells and whistles. This context can easily lead into a mindset of trading or trying to time the market, and is overwhelming to many people who just want to buy bitcoin. Worse are custodial exchanges. Even if the intention to withdraw is there, how many people just never get around to setting up their own bitcoin wallet? Coins left on exchanges are not yours, however safe the exchange claims to be. To top it off, we know some exchanges are engaged in fractional reserve and are selling paper bitcoin. Even using the ""best"" custodial exchange is normalizing the use of exchanges in general. Coins get left behind and people get burned. We can do better.

**Beaver Bitcoin**

Beaver is streamlined to accomplish one thing: buying bitcoin. It's simple, and closer in form to products and platforms people are familiar with. The only feature we offer is a weekly conversion of CAD into bitcoin, delivered to your wallet. There is no sell function so trading and timing the market are off the table. Set up your bitcoin buy and we take care of the rest. CAD for your buy is withdrawn from your bank account automatically every week, and shortly after bitcoin arrives in your wallet. If you like, you don't even need to come back to the site, though of course you can, to pause, cancel, increase or decrease your buy amount at any time.

Below are two more screenshots for more visual context, one is of the onboarding flow, and the other is the dashboard view once onboarding is complete.

Note: the dashboard shows a total of the amount and CAD value of Bitcoin purchased through Beaver. It does not reflect the amount of bitcoin in your personal receiving wallet address.

Success for us is Beaver becoming a recommendation to family members and friends who are just getting into Bitcoin. It's not hard to set up a BlueWallet, and the safety, empowerment and peace of mind that follow are all great things for us as individuals, the Bitcoin network and society. If you're a Bitcoiner in Canada, consider giving Beaver a try. We are always looking for more feedback.

**Wrap up**

To end this post I'll note a few more details about the signup process and Beaver's fee. Feel free to skip this list if you're not Canadian, or maybe you're still curious..

* As a registered Money Services Business (MSB) in Canada we are required to verify your identity when signing up (aka KYC). We use Trulioo to perform this check and do not collect any more info than is necessary to be compliant with Canadian regulations.
* Our fee is set to be $3 + 0.99% of your weekly buy. This might appear high - if you're in Canada you'll also want to compare our price of bitcoin with the buy price of other platforms and exchanges. You'll find our real-time bitcoin price at the top of our homepage. If we are still higher for the amount you are looking to buy, also consider what I mentioned above regarding exchanges and the user experience Beaver provides. If it's not for you, you might still know someone who would benefit from the ease of using Beaver. It really is that easy.
* That said, from now until the end of the year we are encouraging people to try out the platform by offering **zero fees**. Get bitcoin at a great price, feel out a weekly buy and see what you think. At the time of writing this our fee is still shown on the site, but it is not applied to your buy. A $100 buy from now until the end of the year will get you exactly $100 worth of bitcoin at the price shown at the top of the Beaver homepage.
* The minimum weekly buy is $100.
* Regarding the fee and minimum weekly buy, we are a boot strapped startup (there's four of us) with no outside funding, and our unit costs will come down as our volumes grow. Our goal is to lower our fee and the weekly minimum buy amount as we are able to.
* We'll be adding team/contact info to the site soon, in the meantime you can still find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AubreyJesseau) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aubrey-jesseau/).

Below is a screenshot of the wallet I set up for my weekly buy with Beaver. This is roughly four months of weekly $100 buys. For me, this is what it's all about and with Beaver I hope we are making this a real possibility for many more Canadians 🇨🇦

That is not the most useful advice for several reasons:

* it might take weeks for their ledger to arrive, it can be already too late
* in this scenarios, people are scared and fragile, they will most likely make a huge mistake in the rush of the moment (buy from a 3rd party because it's cheaper/faster, storing the seed in their computer, etc)
* using a hardware wallet is confusing and magical for normies, most of them will not heed that advice if they are scared of loosing their funds. Most people don't even understand what they are, they think their bitcoin is stored there, they don't understand it's just a transaction signing device.

There is a much simpler message to broadcast: install bluewallet on your phone, transfer your funds there, worry about getting it to cold storage later after researching the topic with more time.

As things stand right now, a hotwallet from a foss app on your phone is infinitely more secure than an exchange. Modern phones are actually extremely well hardened security wise, much better than PCs.

I even went so far as to buy an old printer on Craigslist to get one that didn't have networking, since that was a risk at the time.

Now I'm looking into migrating to the 'new thing'.  From what I've read, that means getting a hardware wallet.  So I've been researching them.  It appears bip39 is the 'standard', so I started researching that.  And I have some concerns.

In Summary:

&gt; BIP39, which most hardware wallets are basing their mnemonic deterministic keys on, has a status of ""Proposed"".
&gt; 
&gt; https://github.com/bitcoin/bips
&gt; 
&gt; Some other statuses are Rejected, Replaced, Withdrawn, Deferred, or Obsolete. Until the status of the BIP that a mnemonic key is based on is ""Final"", how confident can we really be that this will be supported long-term? If its going to be supported long-term, why isn't it marked ""Final""??
&gt; 
&gt; /r/Bitcoin/comments/ywrqf6/comment/iwl572f/
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; BIP39 is a really bad ""standard"" (is not even properly a standard, though it does intend to be that). For some weird reason, it got mass adopted nevertheless. The BIP reviewers made it abundantly clear to ""Unanimously Discourage for implementation"". https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0039

Gregory Maxwell u/nullc commented:
&gt; The lack of versioning is a serious design flaw in this proposal. On this basis alone I would recommend against use of this proposal. The general design is a thinly disguised brainwallet. Experience with user behavior shows that the user of user passphrases is more or less unconditionally unsafe and yet very attractive to users. If this proposal is implemented it should not be implemented without the checksum enforced. Without it this proposal is an attractive nuisance which has directly caused funds loss.-- Greg Maxwell 2017-03-14

11850,1669251629,False,"Bitcoin at 16k, should I go all in?

I'm really struggling not to go all in right now. I DCA since the 50k level last year and my avg is 25k right now, pretty good in my eyes considering I discovered crypto in 2021. Bitcoin is presently 33% of my investing portfolio and I want more. I 100% believe in the Bitcoin ecosystem and future value that it will bring to society. I see Bitcoin right now as a store of value, I hope it's gonna grow to become much more.

From my perspective Bitcoin can go to 10k maybe but I don't see lower valuation than that. I'm presently watching the 13.5k-14k level with the 400W MA in mind. Considering it's been 1 year since the ATH and 1442 days since the 2018 bottom, I feel like the bottom is in or we are 1-3 months away. Just to keep in mind the 2018 bottom was 1428 days after the 2015 bottom.

Now from the Macro perspective with the FED moves, if we see inflation continue to go down in december CPI, the FED might start slowing down the rate hikes to 0.50 for next meeting and maybe 0.25 for the next one. The FED will not be able to keep raising rates when the unemployment will start to moon. If we keep in mind that markets always price in future event at least 6 months away, the 2023 recession would already be priced in or it is presently being priced in. For that to happen we have to see inflation go down first.

With all the blood on the street, isn't the best time to buy?

So why not go all in at these level? Maybe it's the bottom, maybe we will see another 50% drawdown, I don't know but it seems logic to me long term buying Bitcoin at 15-16k. In the long run it won't make a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

At last,

I don't really know what to expect for the next cycle, at least 100k maybe 200k??

as someone dream being successful since being he’s a kid, i grow up as a gamer 90% Of my time facing my pc screen and discovering Internet, watching Manny Khoshbin Youtube Videos Producer Michael at my 17’s and more that changed my mindset for sure ,playing video games (Online) introduced me to amazing people and specialy opened my mind to since im from a third world country (Algeria) it was something special to know how’s world doing outside .

\-September 2020. it was special becouse my older brother moved to France , so i was the only Boy in my small family (My Mother and my twin Sister) so i felt like im responsible for my familly i need to do something to offer a better life for my sister and specialy my mother who sacrifaced a lot for us since my parents devorced 2009 , my mom did everything to us and she did all her best offering a good life to me &amp; sister and my brother .

i had an idea about crypto since i grrowwed up on internet , it was something that interessted for a long time , you guys know the code you need money to make money and crypto for sure needed money . so i did a lot of reasearch about crypto and i found out about Crypto MINING ? i knew it was something that i need to join and somehow invest in it . But i didnt have the money to , so what then , i started looking for someone to invest for my idea becouse crypto knowlege in algeria is 0 so it was like gambeling , i offered my idea too all my familly and all people that i know have money to invest in me and do Crypto Mining (Gpu mining)

\-Mars 2021. i convainced my uncle who about the idea and how we can make money and stuff of mining , and i did convaince him after +2 months . so at this date (Mars) he first gaved me 2500$ and told me to start and we see how it will goo , we negociated to take 50% 50% Profit of that 2500$.so i started buying graphic cards (2xrtx3070 1xgtx1660) , bought all the equpements and started my first MINING RIG , you cant imagine guys how much i was happy at that time and i felt so special .

2 months later , my uncle did liked the profits i was giving to him monthly and he believed in my project , see we agreed to extand the budget and he gived me another 5000$, and i did buy more graphique cards and build more rigs .

my life there it was something i could never dream i felt like im a prince , i was making +700$ at a month profit just for me at 18years old , ps (Algeria average month salarie is 150–200$) thats why im telling you guys i was living the dream , i bought my mom a golden ring for her birthday i was giving her 200$ a month it was like retiring for her , 1 word it was a Dream come true .

\-November 2021 . Here things seemed to turn around in that month exactly i did my biggest and the life changing mistake, i got convainec by my friend which was close that i can double or even triple the earnings im getting while Mining crypto , by Trading , so the idea is i sell all my Mining Rigs total +8000$ and i invest that money to start Trading in crypto means buy and sell the crypto instead of mining it , and unfortunatly that what i did , right there when i sold my Rigs and bought some crypto Coins the bitcoin Price was at 65000$ , imagine after 1 week guys 1 week bitcoin to 43000$ my wallet went from 8000$ in different coing to 3500$ it was the first chock of my life from there at the end of the year my wallet went to 2000$ it was like someone stabbed me it was something i cant describe it guys and what make it worst is i didnt tell my Uncle (Investor) that i sold my Rig to do Trading that mean i was giving him monthly profit +500$ without even making profit .

\-January 2022, bitcoin price was like 35000$ i think yeah , soo i thought it will goo up again for sure soo i came up with an idea of i get another investor money to invest in Crypto soo when the market went up i will take back my lost money and + i will make a profit , so i got a money from my mother friend i convainced her to give me 5000$ and for that i promised her with a +250$ profit a month, so i did buy crypto again to hold it since i thought we were in the deep , i bought $Dar and $Chr and some other coing with a wallet of 6500$ , 1 and half month later the Russia Declar war to Ukraine and every market in the world just crashed and my wallet crashed with it again from 6500$ to 3000$ bitcoin from 35000$ to 19000$, right there guys i cant describe the feeling the anger i just cant and the feeling of guilty guys i didnt tell anyone of my familly or neither the investors imagine i was giving that profits from my own money after went to 0 i started giving them from their budget, imaging taking everymonths 500$ from 3000$ to givit to them as a profit

september 2022. i sold my pc and my phone to pay them the “profits” while not even having their budget to make a profit , last month imagine my mom sold her ring for me guys the ring that i bought that it was something special , she sold it guys just for me . i will not lie to you guys if i say that im thinking everyday to end my life , i cant live one day more guys i litterly cant , imagine from been at the top to dirrectly under The 0 guys i wish to go back to 0 i wish but im under it

last weeks it was my miserable Birthday i can ever get my 20 years old , and this guys is my story of Me living hell these last 6 months the feeling of fear of the end of the month getting closer and i have to pay +500$ which i dont even have , only god knows what im dealing with right now , and the moral of story dont invest with money that isnt yours and that you are not ready to lose thats first and the secend things guys dont be greedy accepte what god offers you and last thing guys ,

Pray For Me , mybe i will not live longer to see your comments guys but its really helpfull me talking about it and confess to you guys .

Ultimately the problem was fixed and I cancelled the dispute and the company received their payment. But the power of disputing payment was their incentive to resolve the problem.

As we migrate to BTC as common money, there will still be a need for a layer to provide buyer protection against fraud - as all on-chain transactions are final.

11879,1669267128,False,"Hey y'all,

Long time lurker around these, and other crypto related, parts of reddit. I figured this would be the best community to ask an honest question I have regarding self custody, and its idealized future. 

With the recent collapse of FTX, the greater crypto community has been beating the drum of returning to the fundamentals and the importance of ""not your keys not your crypto"". I was listening to an interview on The Breakdown with Jesse Powell of Kraken this evening, and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed was some sort of perfect model for how people kept money in the past. He was drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old days, and it felt like he was romanticizing it. The implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage, on a hardware wallet, is what everyone should be doing. 

I do this. I've done this since I understood the importance of it when I first got into crypto in early 2021 (I know, I'm a baby). I wasn't affected at all by the collapse of FTX, even though I'd purchased from them in the past. Self custody makes sense to me. It's certainly one of the values I identify with and understand as important to the space. Simply put, we don't want some centralized organizations able to freeze our assets, control how we spend our money, or in anyway affect our decisions surrounding it. With all that being said, here's my question.

**If the idealized future of self custody is realized, how does that look for the normal person and will it ever include the same conveniences/assurances that large, centralized, banks offer?** 

The idea of keeping cash under my bed is, frankly, ridiculous. There's so many things that can go wrong. My house could be broken into and my ""shoebox"" taken. I could lose the shoebox. The shoebox could be taken by a family member. If I ever want to spend that money, I have to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere. The list goes on...

Virtually all the same problems exist today with cryptocurrency, but to some degree they're even worse. Want to spend some of my crypto? I'd better have my physical hardware wallet on me, or I'd at least better have transferred some of it to a location that I can access it from the internet. What happens if my house burns down? Maybe I stored my seed phrase in another location, but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it? What happens if my hardware wallet malfunctions? What happens if the company that owns the hardware wallet pushes a bad firmware/software update? Sure, I can always restore that wallet with my seed phrase, but holy shit what a painful process. 

Not to mention the learning curve on all of it is certainly non-trivial. I'm a software engineer. A lot of the interactions intuitively makes some sense to me. I won't get too much into how the expectation of asking some non-technical, 60-70 year old person is fairly ridiculous. I imagine a lot of that will be ironed out over the years as we find a more seamless way to set wallets up and interact with them. 

I want my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is ever as CONVENIENT as trusting some centralized agency with a massive infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend money? Is convenience, and to a certain degree security (fraud protection, insurance, etc.), simply a trade off of having direct control over your money? Or does crypto have some long term solution for that I'm just too close-minded to imagine? Will I always have to carry my hardware wallet around with me?

**Double What you send**

If you would ask me some time ago if this was one of the most common scams, I would say no way. But apparently it is!

They usually make it elaborate - meaning your curiosity gets the better of you and you send 50$ of BTC, receiving 100$ of BTC. And so, your greed starts to pile up, and you start sending higher and higher amounts and they keep sending BTC back. However, along the way you send a huge amount amount of money only to never receive anything back.

**Pro Tip:** Too good to be true applies here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fake Donations Scam**

This has become one of the most common scams. People hack into famous people’s accounts - such as Satoshi Nakamoto’s blog account and famous celebrities’ twitter and Instagram accounts - and impersonate those same celebrities, asking for donations for a specific charity and posting their crypto wallet link

These scams lead to hundreds of thousands in losses for good Samaritans who only intend to help out people in need.

**Pro Tip:** Never Listen to Celebrities (impersonated or otherwise).

&amp;#x200B;

**General Malware**

You get it from downloads on shady websites or recently by browsing on the browsing on websites that download content to your computer without your knowledge. Usually, you either give access to the wallets in your system, or it installs a replace virus that replaces the address you’re sending your crypto to with the perpetrator’s one.

**Pro tip**: I use Malwarebytes, which is pretty good and updated for these types of scenarios, but any major antivirus will do. Also, make sure to double check the addresses you’re sending your crypto to.

I won't say what I purchased, but it was an online purchase on my phone and the vendor had Lightning as an option.  I selected the Lightning option and it prompted me to open one of my Lightning wallets  - options for Blue, Muun, Phoenix, and even Strike and Cashapp automatically came up. Note that I wasn't using my own Lightning node because I wasn't really expecting the Lightning option.  I selected Muun and it automatically pulled up an invoice. Then I touched the send button and boom! Done.   Like split second fast.  The vendor offered a 5% discount for Lightning which makes sense because they get to avoid those card processing fees.

12063,1669344135,False,"If you want control of your bitcoin then you're going to need a wallet.

Your wallet stores the private keys of your bitcoin addresses. These private keys are used to sign transactions so that **only you** can spend your money.

Most people recommend hardware wallets. These wallets store your private keys in the hardware itself so that they don't get exposed to the internet. The transactions are signed inside your hardware wallet and then sent to your computer or phone. The private keys never leave your device.

A hot wallet stores your keys on an internet connected device, such as your phone or your computer. Mobile apps are much more secure than desktop apps. Operating systems like Windows are very vulnerable to attacks and malware.

If you don't have a lot of bitcoin, for example less than 0.10 BTC or so, a mobile wallet is more than enough.

There are many wallets. I personally recommend Green from Blockstream because it is fully open source, has reproducible builds and is made by a reputable company.

Feel free to use other wallet if you want. The steps are very similar.

Here are the steps:

**1)** Install Green: Bitcoin Wallet on your phone.

**2)** Choose ""Add Wallet"", then Bitcoin and then Singlesig.

**3)** Write down your recovery phrase on a piece of paper. Do NOT take a picture of it. Do NOT write this phrase on your computer. Protect this seed. Hide it well. This seed is used to recover your private keys in case you lose your phone.

**4)** Once your wallet is created, click con Receive. This will generate a QR Code and a bitcoin address. You can use either to receive money.

**5)** Go to your exchange and withdraw your money to this bitcoin address.

That's it.

Congratulations!

I have a hard time understanding how bitcoin is our ""answer"". It technically works like digital gold right? We get to mine a certain amount of it and the more time passes, the less we ""find"".

1- What happens if 95% of bitcoin is owned by 1% of the world?

2- If the 99% wants to buy stuff, then what happens? 

3- Can we split 1 bitcoin by any fraction we want or is there a finite amount of numbers after the zero?

Each question can then be split off into other questions depending on the answer..

From what I am starting to realise, to protect ourselves from inflation, debts, etc etc we'd have to go back to our self-sufficient roots, at least partially.

Recently got my multi-sig setup in Sparrow with geo separated private keys/hw wallets and was happy everything is pretty secure.  

I then downloaded BlueWallet on my Android device and imported the xpub (I'm still learning) and it was great that I could see my balance, knowing it was secure in the multi-sig setup, and could get new addresses that I could get that is synchronized with my Sparrow addresses (via xpub) from BlueWallet.  

I then starting learning more about xpubs and got really worried that BlueWallet having the xpub.

I uninstalled BlueWallet from my phone as a first step and don't think the software reports the xpub back to their servers or leaks it (confirmation?).

At this point I'm fine not seeing a real time balance on mobile and only within Sparrow on the desktop.  

Sparrow is set to my own Umbrel / Electrum node for broadcasting, verifying, mempool lookups, etc.  

How worried should I be pertaining to BlueWallet?  Up until recently everything was on a single Ledger and had Ledger Live on my android phone (which I'm assuming also uses an xpub in the same way)

There's a balance of tinfoil hat level stuff and serious privacy or safety issues. I'm not in a jurisdiction where Bitcoin is banned or anything of the sort (though I guess over the years that is subject to change or not change). 

Short of building a new multisig, getting all of the private keys, and re-stamping them into the metal, what's your thoughts? 

Are there any OG/technical folks in the community using BlueWallet on mobile via xpub that is comfortable -and- understand the technical of what it means for xpub used in this way (are there any issues where it makes multi-sig less secure also?) and the technicals behind the scenes of the BlueWallet open source?

BTCapsule is an open-source program that can help timelock your bitcoin to a date of your choosing. You simply generate a P2SH address, add a date, the txid and vout number of your transaction, and the amount of BTC you sent to the address (minus miner fees).

This will create two folders with several files, each containing two separate paper wallets (sender_wallet.txt and receiver_wallet.txt).

The senders_wallet will contain a redeem script that can be used at any time to get your bitcoin back, just in case you ever change your mind. It also contains the master private key used to create the transactions.

The receiver_wallet will contain a timelocked redeem script that is not redeemable until the date you chose. They will also have their own private key to sweep the wallet.

Just copy the receiver_files folder to a flash drive and give it to your loved one. They will not get the bitcoin until you choose, and if you’re (hopefully) still alive when the timelock expires, just redeem from your sender_wallet and create a new transaction.

When you’re ready to redeem, visit a blockchain explorer and broadcast the redeem script. Once it’s been confirmed, you can use BTCapsule’s Sweep Wallet feature.

***Sweep Wallet***

To sweep your wallet, make sure the wallet with your particular redeem script is in the same folder as BTCapsule. Run BTCapsule, enter an address and the amount of BTC you want to redeem (a little less than available if you want to pay miner fees), and it will create a new file called redeem.txt that can be broadcast on a block explorer.

You can download BTCapsule (testnet only) for Windows and Linux and learn more at:

When a Bitcoin miner mines BTC, I understand that it's adding more BTC into circulation, but is the BTC that is added into circulation the actual reward they're receiving for successfully mining? Then, the miner could do a few things with it like:  
\- sell their BTC that they received through an exchange  
\- transfer it to someone  
\- keep the reward

Is this correct?  


Also, do exchanges have to first ""buy"" or ""mine"" BTC in order to sell it to the general public? If this is true, if the exchange has no BTC, is it possible for a customer to still buy BTC through that exchange?

12320,1669468720,False,"I promise this is not FUD, trying to have an honest discussion here.  And I use the term 'bad actors' very loosely here.

I just got done watching the latest 'What Bitcoin Did' podcast ([https://youtu.be/WfpqMnKG9N4?t=2233](https://youtu.be/WfpqMnKG9N4?t=2233)), and part of it really stuck out in my head: 

Why is the BTC hash rate at literal all-time highs when price is so low and miners are reaching a point where they are not profitable?  There was mention of 'concern that maybe nation-states are starting to turn on machines and mine at whatever it costs to get around sanctions'.  For example Russia mining with their close-to-free natural gas.

So I started to think what if this was to actually happen?  There was some incentive (either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amount of BTC, or to possibly attempt to attack the network, could be for many reasons) to flat out mine at a loss?  This would lead to honest mining companies turning off their machines because it was not profitable to run them.

Different places pay different energy costs, so obviously this would impact some countries more than others.  I assume (maybe wrongly) that the US would be the first to be non-profitable should the hash rate continue to climb, while BTC price continues to fall.

I know (at least I thought) a lot of the design of Bitcoin is based on game theory that miners will continue to join the network as adoption (and price) increases.  

What happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly have close to free energy?  What would happen in this scenario when some entity is mining even if there is no financial incentive to do so?

Would the network difficulty drop enough for 'honest' miners to keep mining to secure the network in this case?  I assume places like Kazakhstan have very cheap energy that would allow honest miners there to continue to mine well after places like the US have turned off their miners.

Hey all, this is a genuine question specifically relating to Capital Gains Tax in the UK.

For those who may not know, we have to pay CGT on £12k or more per  year. There is some weird algorithm they use, but if we are talking  figures of £100k+ then you are looking at losing circa 20% on CGT.

I understand fees, taxes etc, but i genuinely don't understand why  CGT is so much given that the gov are not active in my investment at  all. But that's not my question - more of a rant!

My question is;

I brought around half a BTC a while back and subsequently that bank account has been closed that I made the purchase from.  
 

I know that when when / if I sell my BTC off for fiat, the tax man  will come calling. I am a hodler and expect to hodl for at least 12  years.

As per GDPR my bank would have destroyed any information they have  one me - If they haven't, I can request that they do this in a few  years.

If I sell my BTC off and the tax man comes calling for my CGT, what,  in theory, would stop me from saying that I brought my BTC in cash for  £400k and am now selling at a loss thus meaning that I don't need to pay  CGT?

After all, HMRC wont be able to prove that I haven't, given that the  original proof of transaction has since been destroyed by the banks as  per legislation.

1.) Bitcoin's security budget is unsustainable because its transaction fees haven't and won't grow nearly enough to make up for BTC issuance reduction from the halvenings. This is exacerbated if Lightning Network becomes bigger as there will be even less transaction fees for miners. This will result in miners leaving due to unprofitability and 51% attacks will occur thus destroying the security of Bitcoin.

2.) Bitcoin isn't quantum resistant. This will result in attackers being able to spend BTC that's not theirs when quantum computers level up.

12447,1669546887,False,"In a nutshell. Banks are a bit like FTX, highly leveraged and can't sustain a bank-run in many cases.

Fortunately deposits are insured. In the US the insured amount is  up to $250k and the EU up to $100k.

Prior the financial crisis of 2008, if banks were too big to fail the government(taxpayers) would save them but since the cost of doing so is becoming too big they introduced bail-ins instead of bail-outs.

Bail-ins mean that banks can take their customers deposits if they are insolvent. Basically they can legally do what SBF did to pay their debts. The bank will just steal your deposits to save them and no you won't get them back.

Fortunately you are still protected up to the insured amount ($250k) but everything above can be taken from you.

Now if we assume that there will be another financial/banking crisis which is almost certain and if we assume the next crisis will be bigger than the last one which is also likely because that is what we have seen in the past it's just a question of time before some people are going to lose a lot of money in a bank that was supposed to be regulated, trusted and safe.

The reporting requirement would see all brokers report transactions under the current tax code.

Industry proponents worried the definition would be too broad, capturing entities like miners and other parties that don’t actually facilitate transactions.

Another provision included in the bill to amend tax code section 6050I has also stoked fear in the crypto industry. The law, written nearly 40 years ago to apply to in-person cash transactions over $10,000, essentially requires recipients to verify the sender’s personal information and record his or her Social Security number, the nature of the transaction and other information, and report the transaction to the government within 15 days.""

We all want Bitcoin to hit a million, we all want it to become a global currency for many reasons.

For that to happen, I believe we need big companies, like Coinbase, Binance, Crypto etc in order to get there.

Hypothetically speaking, if you meet a random person who knows nothing about any crypto in general, yet they are interested enough to buy some coin and join the club, you’ll need to tell them how to do it.

If you tell that random person who knows nothing about this, that they need to first buy coin, then buy a cold storage wallet, then transfer coin to said wallet in order to keep their coin from being used as equity by a major company, they will (in my opinion) be very unlikely to buy Bitcoin.

It’s too many steps, too much work for a newbie. 

Solution? Embrace major exchanges that provide an easy foot in the door. This gets us to a million sooner. 

Every GME nerd thought direct registering their shares would send them to the moon. Yeah….. going real well for them.

When you meet someone new to crypto, maybe just say, 

“yeah, there are a few public companies with verified financials who you can easily purchase crypto through, once you understand enough about it, you can even move your crypto into a physical wallet that no one or banks can control.”

In conclusion, 

I believe we NEED major companies out there to get us to the moon. Embrace that and spread the word. There is a difference between private companies and public companies.

12588,1669625057,False,"Ok first of all it makes sense to think about the current version of instant payment. Credit cards. Why isn't a credit card enough?

Well, we all are forced to use credit cards in our daily lives and to risk our funds in the bank. If you think about how credit cards are even designed it really makes you wonder why on earth would I put all my sensitive data on a piece of plastic readable for everyone finding the card. Leading to unauthorised transactions which skyrocketed the last decade.  


From a merchant perspective the support of credit card payments comes with two mayor disadvantages:

* Banks function as gatekeepers
* High fees for accepting credit card payments

Well... if only there was an innovative solution for this problem.  


**The lighting network.**

The lighting network as a layer 2 payment protocol on top of Bitcoin addresses these problems.   
It is intended to enable fast transactions among participating members and enhances the privacy and speed of Bitcoin payments, while maintaining the same level of security.  
There is no gatekeeper. Anyone with a $50 smartphone can send money to any institution accepting lightning payments without any restrictions and without any record of the payment being made.  
The fees are usually a few sats, not even measurable in fiat currency at the time. What is a fee of 1-5 sats? $0.000169 to $0.00084? Close to nothing.  
Compare that to the current fees merchants are being charged for credit card payments and try to convince me merchants are not interested in adopting lightning payments.  
Compare the amount of possible transactions per seconds. While payment processors like Visa and Mastercard are able to handle 65.000 transactions per second, the lightning network averages 1.000.000 transactions per second, making it the most efficient payment system to be ever existed.

* Where can I find the Current Target? How is the current target defined?
* Why is the MAX target fixed at 00000000FFFF00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and not F's only? which would be the highest hexadecimal figure
* How to interpret the Difficulty figure? 
   * For instance, today we have a difficulty of **36,950,494,067,222**. 
   * What does this figure mean exactly? 
      * Does it mean that we would need an average of 36.950 TH as hash power to find the target hash?
      * I can see that an average ASIC has a hash power of 166TH/s, thus, it would take 0.21s to find it out... which is not logical... where am I wrong? :-D

In the filing with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, the company said it had more than 100,000 creditors, with liabilities and assets ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion. 

“BlockFi looks forward to a transparent process that achieves the best outcome for all clients and other stakeholders,” stated Mark Renzi from Berkeley Research Group, which serves as BlockFi’s financial adviser.

In June, the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange agreed to provide the company with a $400 million credit line. BlockFi’s chief executive, Zac Prince, then said the loan would provide “access to capital that further bolsters our balance sheet.” The deal gave FTX the option to buy BlockFi.

The agreement also meant that BlockFi was financially entangled with FTX, which has itself filed for bankruptcy this month after a series of revelations about mishandled customer funds and abandoned acquisition plans by rival exchange Binance. A few days after the exchange collapsed, BlockFi suspended withdrawals, explaining that it had “significant exposure” to FTX, including undrawn amounts from its credit line and assets.

The New Jersey-based BlockFi was created in 2017 and as of last year claimed more than 450,000 retail clients who could obtain loans in minutes, without credit checks.",BlockFi has become the latest casualty following the collapse of the major cryptocurrency exchange,0.78

In the internet crash, 20 years ago, this couldn't happen. There wasn't a youtuber promoting pets.com or any internet company. Youtube didn't exist. Companies couldn't attract investors with this technology.

But with the Crypto crash there are hundreds of youtubers who promoted ftx, blockfi and others. And they affected thousands or millions of common people.

Maybe they didn't know about the ftx and Blockfi situation. What I'm saying is that they just don't recognize their mistakes or they aren't transparent and say how much were they getting to promote these platforms.

And yet, there hundreds of youtubers who chose not to promote these platforms.

THE POINT

It's amazing that these guys just keep making videos and forget their suscribers. If you followed their ""suggestions"" you would be in a pretty bad situation.

How many guys trusted these youtubers? I mean this one (video link) literally says ""I promise"".

How is this possible? No one cares? Youtubers don't care? And how is it possible that suscribers keep watching their videos?

12763,1669685255,False,"I have been thinking about a trustless solution for inheritance. Here's a method I've come up with after some learning:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Ensure you and the recipient of your inheritance has access to a wallet.

2. Create a timelocked TX from your cold storage with the appropriate time delay (1 year for example).

3. Sign the TX, without broadcasting it and save it somewhere it will be found if you pass away, or give it to your lawyer.

4. Before the timelock duration has elapsed, move your coins to a new address within your cold storage wallet

&amp;#x200B;

If you die or are unable to access your coins, the recipient needs only access to the signed timelocked transaction to access the funds (after the timelock has elapsed)

&amp;#x200B;

Possible drawbacks include:

\- technical know-how to broadcast a TX

\- possibility of making a mistake

\- doesn't protect against getting murdered by recipient

\- doesn't protect against getting locked up in prison longer than the duration of the timelock (unless signed TX is kept with a lawyer)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have the time to google into that right now. This question came to my mind recently: Are all wallet addresses existent right from the beginning and just show up on blockchain when the first one sends coins there? Then again I thought: Wait, it's a private key plus public key thing. Your private key (seed) is generated first and then can generate public keys on chain. But new wallet adresses don't need one block of time to start to work, do they?. Also I don't need to be online to ""register"" that private key into existence because there are things like paper wallets, generated on an offlince pc including the wallet addresses where people send their coins to.

12857,1669723823,False,"I'm now even more convinced that FTX and SBF were/are part of a much bigger operation and am now  more curious as to why others not only disagree but adamantly disagree.  I could be wrong but if I had to put a number on it 

90% sure Gov officials broke laws in helping FTX and SMF

80% sure the SEC was aware of what was going on and turned a blind eye.  

100% sure journalists have been instructed to push a narrative about SBF or FTX.

70% SBF will face no punishment and that will be accepted by 99% of the population. 

Consider it in these terms. SBF directly lied to customers and stole their money rather than operate a profitable risk free business taking fees so they could pull the biggest financial scam we have ever seen in broad daylight. His parents, mom the founder of a large political pact to which millions have been donated by SBF and his circle and his father ""*a well-connected professor at Stanford Law. While Fried was more involved in the political side of SBF’s operation, Bankman was heavily involved in the business itself, including helping to raise funds to finance the firm. Bankman is a leading* [*expert*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2004.4.08) *on state and federal tax shelters, and some in the cryptocurrency space have speculated that he might have used his expertise to create the corporate structure (see below) of his son’s offshore financial firms.""* 

A house is also in their name which is suspicious regardless of how you look at it. They are experts in their fields, well connected to Gov officials and never even thought at any point something was going on. I don't care how you think this happened, I can promise you the two people that would know that this is something they would want to avoid even if they fully believed FTX was legit would be his parents. It's not like they only knew their son from how he was presented to the rest of the world. Looking at SBFs past interviews now and his outright refusal to answer what he's asked there is no way he parents weren't aware of what was going on. Caroline Ellison's father worked with Gensler when they both [taught at MIT.](https://news.mit.edu/2021/gary-gensler-nominated-chair-sec-0119) The majority of Maxine waters committee is compromised and involved with FTX and we are  just supposed to assume NONE of these high ranking people ever thought to insulate themselves in anyway? In the business world the entire executive team of large companies work very hard to not even give the appearance of wrongdoing even in situations they know nothing is going on. 

What's even crazier is the fact what FTX exploited just so happened to be something that we now know, knowledgeable people in finance or the crypto space knew was possible. What I mean is anyone who understood this could have designed specific steps to create a semi sustainable situation where FTX was essentially creating money out of thin air while inflating its value. Spending hundreds of millions on homes and donations. Oddly they were 'hacked' and the accounts emptied last minute. The New York Times is hosting SBF at their conference? These 13 or 20 kids in no way were capable of running this operation and in no way is it believable they could.

Hell, the average person thinks cash (pieces of paper) has intrinsic value and that they ""own"" their homes. This is not their fault.

12891,1669736105,False,"Suppose that after running `--reindex-chainstate` or `--reindex`, you find out the blockchain is corrupt but you got a (also corrupt) backup of the Bitcoin blockchain (including chainstate, txindex, blocks). Bitcoind will run just fine, as it only checks a limited number of blocks (of the backup). 

&amp;nbsp;

The following is a smart and fast way to copy the correct blocks from your local blockchain (preferably to a new disk) and only download corrupted blocks from other bitcoin nodes:

&amp;nbsp;

Start another full node (say bitcoind B) on the same server (different port and datadir) next to your usual full node (say bitcoind A). Then connect bitcoind B **only** to bitcoind A via an internal IP address which therefore serves blocks very fast. Because bitcoind A has a corrupted blockchain, it can't provide all the blocks. So sometimes bitcoind B can't continue. Then add an external node (say node C) to node B via the `bitcoin-rpc addnode &lt;ip&gt; add` command. Node B will then get a number of correct blocks from external node C (but slower). After some time remove node C via `bitcoin-rpc addnode &lt;ip&gt; remove` followed by `bitcoin-rpc disconnectnode &lt;ip&gt;` and node B will continue getting blocks **only** from node A (very fast).

&amp;nbsp;

To connect node B only to node A, add the following to B's bitcoin.conf:

    blocksonly=1

    listen=0

    port=&lt;different from port A&gt;

    rpcport=&lt;different from rpcport A&gt;

    maxconnections=0

    addnode=&lt;local ip address of A (like: 192.168.178.3:8333)&gt;

12894,1669735474,False,"Hello, i have an old electrum (2.8.3)  watching only wallet on my main online (to the internet connected) PC, which still runs windows 7. This old version of electrum stopped working some time ago (like years ago) because i dont remember... There was some hack or whatever of electrum(?) (some exploit found?) and the devs disabled the old versions of electrum from functioning (to force the users to upgrade to the latest versions which shouldnt have any bugs or exploits that were used in the hack). So my watching only electrum wallet on my online PC simply stopped working, gave some errors, couldnt connect to the ""network"" etc... I didnt update anything since i didnt really needed electrum (or BTC) at that point. So i just let it pass, didnt care for it. So few years later - today, i still have the old version installed. 

If one would like to check the wallet balances in this watching only wallet/electrum, than its needed to instal the newest version of electrum that would run on windows 7. AFAIK thats the  4.1.5 version (the ""latest"" that still runs on windows 7). Correct?

&amp;#x200B;

All i need to do is to:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Download the Electrum 4.1.5 from a safe source?

2) Check the checksum, PGP or whatever (i dont remember :-), but i know i did it the 1st time few years ago)

3) Instal the 4.1.5 version over my old 2.8.3 version (instal it as watching only wallet if that option comes up)

4) Enter the WATCHING ONLY SEED for this online electrum wallet?

5) Check the balances of wallets/adresses contained within this electrum wallet

DONE

&amp;#x200B;

Correct? And since its only ""watching-only"" wallet, theres really no way for anyone to lose BTC, i just want to check the balance. I dont intend (for now) to use this wallet for signing or anything, just to check the balances...

That should be safe right...? Even on windows 7 (outdated OS) and on outdated version of Electrum (4.1.5)...? Simply installing it over the old version (2.8.3 that for some reason stopped working few years ago)...

So there are theories floating around that the FTX fiasco and SBF (Sam Bankman Fried or whatever the name of that crook is) was a form of attack (from the STATE (FED whatever)) on Bitcoin...?

Are there some well thought out articles on this issue giving a deep dive into it...? Is it possible...?

Lets not forget that BTC acted quite INCREDIBLY WEIRD this last cycle.... 

1) 1st we got only a POOR top at 64K (69K if you wish), like WTF is that... Thats pathethic for BTC...

2) We got basically a double TOP (!?)... Again, this has NEVER happened in the decade+ long history of BTC... NEVER...

3) We got almost a typical bear market bottom (-77,5%) or whatever... Thats almost up there with the depths of previous bear markets... SO the depth of the bottom is almost typical, WITHOUT the top being typical (we got LOW/POOR top, but got (almost) regularly deep BOTTOM)...

For example, what would happen if the transatlantic communication cable (and all other submarining cables) were severed, essentially isolating the different networks that make up the internet? Since there would be no connection between Europe and the United States, how would these two parts of the Bitcoin network continue on if they are unable to communicate with each other? Would transactions within those separate isolated networks be merged together seamlessly once the network connection was restored? How would this network disconnect affect instances where someone in the US was trying to send/receive BTC to/from someone in Europe?   


I realize scenarios like this are minimized by the existence of other ISP services like Starlink, but for the sake of the thought experiment I am curious what would happen if satellite internet services were not in the picture.

So his argument is that lightning is great if you send money back and forth between parties, but not if you need to add liquidity to that channel on a repeated basis.

12979,1669759946,False,"Our son is 6 and he keeps asking for Bitcoin. He asks for Bitcoin because Dad loves Bitcoin. In fact the only thing Dad loves besides him and mommy is Bitcoin. People come to our house under the guise of “hanging out and enjoying each others company”, but then Dad corners them and urges them to buy and hold as much Bitcoin as they can. 

Anyway our son is at the age where he is losing teeth and gets visited by the tooth fairy. The tooth fairy usually leaves him garbage fiat which he stuffs into a wooden alligator where it will eventually reduce to .1% of its current value. He has a loose tooth right now and I am worried if he sees another dollar under his pillow he is going to start asking to keep the teeth instead, as they may be more valuable in the long run. 

And so, thinking that this may be the perfect opportunity for our son to earn his first Bitcoin, dad orange pilled the tooth fairy. Just like dad did to his Aunt Sarah, his swim instructor, the girl who cuts his hair, Kira and Michael’s parents and his speech pathologist. Turns out his 17 year old baby sitter is already laser eyed as fuck. Good for her. 

The tooth fairy is on board, but only under two conditions:

Condition 1: The tooth fairy thinks it is important that leaving Bitcoin is an opportunity to learn about it and secure it properly. After all, the Bitcoin that gets left will be the only of that Bitcoin ever created and if its gone, its gone forever. Just like his baby tooth that fell out. 

Condition 2: It has to be fun to find Bitcoin under your pillow in the morning when you’re 6 years old.

But how does a tooth fairy leave 30,000 sats under a pillow in a way that a 6 year old is going to be very excited about finding? My kid claims to love Bitcoin but if he wakes up and sees a folded up 12 word seed phrase he is going to be pissed that the tooth fairy is making him practice reading first thing in the morning.

12980,1669759516,False,"I would like to warn everyone about Swan Bitcoin...because I feel this is important for people to know about. I have been DCA'ing on Swan for the span of 6 days. Today, out of nowhere, my account was closed for ""fraud"" and my money in Swan locked up to 60 days, according to their email. I am shocked - considering people talked so highly of Swan on previous posts in this subreddit. This is unacceptable to hold people's money hostage for this long.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to note, my mom also wired over $50,000 into Swan after I convinced her to invest into BTC and her funds are now also locked for 60 days. We run a family owned business (my parents opened over 30 years ago) and are relatively well off, never been accused of fraud by any financial company until we encountered Swan Bitcoin. Please, stay clear of this company if you do not want a similar experience!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: this was the email I received when they decided to close my account:

""This is xxx with Swan. I'm writing to let you know that our Fraud team has decided to close your Swan account. At this time, we think it poses a higher level of risk than we are comfortable with and we are going to part ways. According to our terms of service (1.5) we ""may reject your application to create your Account, or cancel an existing Account, for any reason, in our sole discretion.""

For your convenience, our terms of service can be found here: [https://www.swanbitcoin.com/terms/](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/terms/)

You will be able to withdraw any bitcoin that remains in custody after 60 days time. We hold it for 60 days to make sure that we can financially cover the expected bank rejections / chargebacks. If we receive a chargeback from your bank we have to sell the bitcoin to finance it. Any bitcoin remaining after 60 days from now will be available for your withdrawal at that time - you may reach out to us.

Please note a decision to close your account does not constitute an accusation of any wrongdoing. Decisions like these involve a lot of internal risk assessment and we appreciate that you may not agree with our decision to close your account. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Edit2: They had me re-verify my ID and the issue was finally resolved. They said they thought it was a case of ID theft.... It is still very upsetting that their initial resolution was to lock people's funds for 2 months without a proper explanation in the account closure email. They should have been clear with me from the get-go. Regardless...see below for their response. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you for doing that selfie and ID check so quickly. Our Risk team has closed the investigation and notated that this was a ""false positive"" and have re-opened yours and your mother's accounts. We have sent a follow-up email to your mother as well.

These false positives are no joke and we work really hard to make sure good users don't get caught in the crosshairs. Clearly that didn't happen today.

In Casa there’s a feature that reminds you to do a “health check” every so often. Basically you plug in your hardware key and it says “yep, key is good.” I dig Casa but feel like their 3 of 5 option is too expensive.

I’d like to set up my own 3 of 5 multisig (prob via BlueWallet or Sparrow) but would like to do health checks every so often. What’s the best way to do that? Would you send some bitcoin to yourself or would you setup a transaction and then just not broadcast it? Is there a better way to do this?

Most likely would use a SeedSigner. That device would let me enter my wallet and see the wallet‘s fingerprint. Would that be enough or is it better to see if you can perform a transaction?

Right now, obviously there are larger macro-economic and socio-political factors at play that are suppressing Bitcoin's market value. However:

* Bitcoin is a deflationary asset
* USD - and other national currencies - are inflationary assets

If you are to value BTC against the American dollar with these two factors in mind, would it not be reasonable to expect the market value of Bitcoin - relative to USD - to increase based on both of these factors? As in, Bitcoin's value increases over time due to its decreasing *new* supply (mining rewards halving), but also simultaneously gains relative strength over the USD simply due to inflationary pressure on the USD?

If this is the case, I think this relative gain in strength simply due to lack of inflationary effects (which all other currencies are exposed to) could be one of the largest driving factors in BTC gaining value relative to national currencies - especially given the current situation with high inflation.

EDIT: Since I'm getting downvoted to oblivion I thought I'd clarify something. I'm not claiming that Bitcoin in the long-run is correlated with the NASDAQ. But in the last year, the [data](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/09/bitcoins-correlation-with-stocks-comes-back-as-economic-factors-roil-markets/) shows that it undeniably is. My point is that the recent FTX/BlockFi collapses doesn't appear to have changed that correlation, meaning there's no structural change in how the current marginal investor views Bitcoin.

13224,1669882970,False,"Many people reject the idea of mass bitcoin adoption because they believe that the majority of the population is not going to be buying BTC, or they simply believe that most people are not tech-savvy enough to do so.

What these people fail to understand is that mass adoption does not mean mass ownership. During the gold standard most people owned little to no gold, yet trough their currency they had adopted a gold based system and had indirect exposure to gold.

Mass adoption does not mean everyone will have a wallet app on their phones and a hardware wallet at home. It means that your pension fund will own Bitcoin. Your insurance plan will have a 10% allocation. Your workplace has a small ""just-in-case"" allocation on their balance sheet. The purchase you do at 7eleven in your local currency will be settled using the lightning network instead of the old system from Visa/Mastercard. The app you use to send money to your friends to split the Uber cost will be using lightning. Your local and state government will quietly own some too, either directly or trough some financial vehicle like a trust or an ETF.

Most people will live their lives as normal but the services that make their world go around will be using magic internet money and they probably will not even know it. The only clue will be that they are somehow better off financially than before.

Also, with the adoption of CBDCs increasing rapidly amongst countries it seems inevitable that this is going to happen. Although, looking at this topic from a macro level, how would this affect Bitcoin? From my understanding, if all countries were to develop their own CBDC wouldn’t the coins be able to track the coins itself? Thus leading to any amounts of fiat that were traced back from BTC/Crypto to be  frozen, if governments decided to restrict cryptocurrencies as a whole? I also understand that money in general is very fluid and can seep through the cracks to retrieve it but from what I have seen, we may have a very difficult obstacle to cross in the future.

Using advanced technology, users could slip on a headset and be transported to a different world, one where the weather was perfect and the skies were clear. It was a temporary escape from the harsh realities of the world outside.

But not everyone could afford the expensive VR equipment, and a growing divide emerged between the haves and the have-nots. The wealthy retreated into their virtual worlds, while the poor were left to struggle with the consequences of climate change.

As the situation worsened, a new currency emerged: Bitcoin. The decentralized digital currency allowed people to transact without the need for banks, which were struggling to keep up with the changing world.

But the government soon intervened, issuing its own digital currency in an effort to regain control over the economy. The central bank digital currency, or CBDC, was hailed as the solution to the problems caused by Bitcoin.

But not everyone was convinced. Some saw the CBDC as just another tool of the wealthy elite, further entrenching the divide between the rich and the poor.

When I send bitcoin to another wallet it arrives in a minute or two. I can then spend that bitcoin. What happens in that one or two minutes? Before you answer, there are several words that are often confused which is verify, validate, confirm and finalise.   

  
First there is the ledger which is spread across thousands of computers like I myself run a copy on my old laptop. But Im not a miner. Is it these random computers the transaction immediately travels to, that detect invalid transactions? Are we network nodes? 

On the image it shows at 10 secs, the transaction is propagated and VALIDATED by the network nodes and this happens before the miners enter the process. So the ledger computers have ""validated"" the transactions and these computers like mine must be the network nodes? 

The next step it says ""Miners include the transaction in the next block to be mined. This looks like the first meeting between miners and transactions? They havent validated anything at this stage.

Next step says ""Mining time"". (If the transactions are already validated what does the mining do at this point?)

The winning miner who solves the puzzle is rewarded with some bitcoin.

Then it says the nodes (my node on my laptop) verify the result and propagate the block.

I dont understand what this means at the end it says ""New confirmations appear with each new block created.""

I thought the private and public keys being the digital signatures would be the first level of verification or validation. (Which one is the correct word)? When keys all match up and the transaction is sent and received, isnt that a validation of sorts?   


* Do the miners verify (or validate) transactions, and if so when exactly? Do they ""confirm"" them? At what stage is a transaction ""finalised""?
* If a transaction isnt finalised when I receive it how can it be ok to spend straight away?   
* Are the miners called full nodes? 
* I am a node thru my old laptop to check on the miners they are following the rules?  
* So are the network nodes the ledgers, the full nodes the miners, and the nodes the verifiers of the miners?

13466,1669980264,False,"Dear all,
I quickly wanted to share with you one of my experience I made the last two days.

There are many people out there who are already sympathetic to Bitcoin but are afraid or clueless of how to really use it in a practical way or even just how to buy/invest. 

They are afraid of the registration process involved at an exchange, the creating of a non-custodial wallet, the money transfer from your bank to the exchange, the trading/buying process, the on-chain transaction and so...and it would take some time (sometimes days) to walk them through all of that (not even mentioning DEXs).

So during the past 2 days I found a way which helped already 3 people to jump though the hoops in minutes:

I just tell them to show them an easy way how they can use Bitcoin to buy at their local grocery store and usually people start to get excited!

That's what I do:

1. Ask them to download the phoenix wallet
2. Write down the seed and keep it secret
3. Send me a ln invoice/ show qr code 
4. I send them 10000 sat from my ln-node via the Zeus app

At this point people are already amazed how fast and easy everything was!!


Then I tell them:

5. Download bitrefill
6. Check out all the stores there, what do you like? Hey look there is one of our biggest grocery stores!
7. PayPal me a small amount of money so that I can send you more satoshis and you can get yourself a gift card.
8. I send them more sats to their phoenix wallet via ln
9. They enter the email address at bitrefill, creat an ln invoice with my help at bitrefill and then they already transfer the sats to bitrefil within seconds with a little of help.
11. They discover that they get 1% Cashback in sats and get even more excited 
10. Bitrefil sends the gift card within seconds to their email address, they unseel the card and are shocked how easy this was.

During the last 24 hours 3 people who had nothing to do with lightning have now a first glimps of what is possible and have some necessary tools already installed on their smartphones.

Of course I do not know whether or not they will now dive in deeper, but it was an amazing experience for me and I believe also for them.

This is a reminder that we're currently in a short low-drama valley. No new exchanges are going bankrupt after the news of FTX, Genesis and BlockFi. You have a period of respite from the drama.

&amp;#x200B;

So regardless of what exchange you're on, move a small amount off the exchange to cold storage. This is about risk management, not conspiracy theories. Keep only an amount on exchanges that you willing to lose completely.

&amp;#x200B;

The time to act is not when the rumours of liquidity start surfacing. By then, you've already lost it and bankruptcies are just a formality at that point (ie. Celsius, Voyager, etc).

13509,1669993566,False,"First of all, if you think the people running exchanges are honest and ethical, then there is no hope for you. They *could* be, but they also couldn't. Stop blindly trusting these people.

Now, let me explain.

**How does having a big balance allow them to sell paper bitcoin?**

If they have a lot of bitcoin then they can very easily sell fake bitcoin with little risk. For example, if they have 500,000 BTC, they can sell an additional 1,000,000 fake coins knowing that as long as no more than 33% of users withdraw their money, they can get away with it.

Now suppose they only have 10,000 BTC. They can no longer sell 1 million fake coins because people would not be able to withdraw to their wallets.

**How does selling paper bitcoin suppress price?**

Suppose you have 3 gold coins and I offer to buy them from you. You refuse because this is all you have and you're saving them for the future. You're not willing to sell them at the current gold price of $1784. This puts upward pressure on the price. I need to bid higher if I want to buy them from you.

Now imagine you have the ability to create fake gold coins without me knowing the difference. You can create 100 coins out of thin air. Now you don't give a shit, you can sell me some coins even at a cheaper price, because they cost you nothing. You can continue to sell these coins at low prices, putting downward pressure on the price.

There are many other factors determining the price of bitcoin (trading, longs, shorts, derivatives, arbitrage), but the basics of supply and demand are behind all of it.

By taking bitcoin into self custody, we take power away from the exchanges and ""finance"" guys.

**Have you already withdrawn your bitcoin from exchanges?**

If you don't know how, start here:

I know, this might be a very controversial take for this subreddit, but these companies' marketing has been pretty damn pervasive.

Too many times on this subreddit I see people recommending these products as something secure, as almost foolproof.

Unfortunately, that's  just their marketing at work, and it's sadly working.  Take ledger for example:I'll copy my comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zatcbe/comment/iynjkh1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&gt;The company has leaked 273k people's data with 0 recourse,Due to shitcoin support, bitcoin was sent instead of shitcoins [source](https://decrypt.co/37651/ledger-exploit-makes-you-spend-bitcoin-instead-of-altcoins).If you use ledger live instead of something like electrum, it phones home to ledger's servers.Which if said servers are down you cannot transact [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/jurv7w/ther_server_could_not_handle_your_request_please/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).It's also closed sourced so who knows what the hell it's doing under the covers.Not to mention it's not airgapped.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imo coldcard is much better as a solution.  


&amp;#x200B;

Also to quote MisterRGnome, if you MUST use these devices, do NOT use their bundled in wallet software, use something like electrum, blue, sparrow, ANYTHING else to handle your signing/transacting.

Trezor is similarly bad, maybe slightly less.

they're open sourced, but [They have been hacked if you have physical access to the wallet](https://www.coolwallet.io/kraken-hacks-trezor-in-15-minutes/).You'd think a company that sells itself on security would you know, revise their hardware to make this impossible, but they haven't!

There are myriads of issues with so many hardware wallets.

coldcard comes closest to being good, but they're not without fault either.

Their recent mk4 comes with NFC support that flies in the face of what their philosophy was. They're appealing to the masses and trying to get your money, making their device less secure in the process.

We hung out last week and he was interested this time in discussing Bitcoin.  It didn't really get anywhere, but I probably didn't do the best job in defending Bitcoin.  The fact that he is a very prominent finance professor didn't make it easy.

Today he sent me an opinion piece written by Paul Krugman that just came out yesterday which basically declares crypto to be dead.  Yet again.  Ths time I can gather my thoughts properly before responding, but I thought I would share them here in case anyone has any comments on my response that could be helpful:

""Thank you for sending me this article.  I hate to parrot the same type of talking points that Krugman hears, but I do believe that Krugman ""doesn't get it"".  More to the point, though: no-one has explained it to him, because what is written in his article is mostly unrelated to what ""enthusiasts"" would talk about.

First, forget about anything non-Bitcoin.  Second, and the main point: Inflation is, generally speaking and in the last 100 years, a horrible thing.  If inflation comes about from positive economic activity, then fine.  But if you sum up all of the inflation over the last 100 years in the USA, I am guessing it has been a huge negative on overall society.  This is a claim that I am making, unverified (by me).  If I am wrong about this, then I am very misinformed and **would gladly relinquish a lot of my support for Bitcoin**.

Inflation is **the main** problem that bitcoin is trying to solve.  Satoshi Nakomoto probably said it best in as few words as possible:

""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.  Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.""

Satoshi's #1 point above is about the debasing of fiat currencies.  His #2 point is fractional reserve lending.  Why is fractional reserve lending a problem?  Seems to have worked all these years.  Except that it hasn't, and in 2008 the banks had to be bailed out, with us taxpayers footing the bill in the short term and the long term.

You will notice that Krugman's article states nothing about the above.  And that's why he ""doesn't get it"".

This is what Bitcoin is all about.  But the most natural follow-up question is: How does Bitcoin solve the above problems?  Why Bitcoin?  Why not rocks or seashells or stuffed animals?  That is another conversation.""

I am drawn to this competition with the fiat system. Not only is the money broken, but so are education, science, food, and culture. Bitcoin is a great opt-out. Self-sovereignty is the primary product of this space. A hard, trustless, decentralized, verifiable, immutable, global money system is the foundation. Web5 goes on top. Distinguishing features of this tour de force are privacy, security, and ownership.

Today in Bitcoin, there are two user categories: technical and non-technical. The former can wget Bitcoin Core and verify its GPG signature from the command line. He can run a BTC full-node alongside a C-Lightning instance and point both to a multisig wallet. His keys were generated--and he signs transactions--on an air-gaped computer.

Contrarily, a non-technical user shirks self-custody best practices; he refuses to expend the requisite funds and energy. Therefore, to onboard an ""intransigent minority,"" developers must simultaneously create infrastructure, products/services for power users, and highly abstracted, easy-to-use interfaces.  

I am looking for peers and mentors to share their background: how they began working in the Bitcoin space. Also, I want to anticipate the shape of the network: decentralized IDs paired with spending wallets, connected in an off-chain edge computing meshnet; cell phones or dedicated hardware operating as signing devices, perhaps pointing to a VPS or home node.

I think people do completely overestimate governments and CBDCs.

First of all CBDCs will just be digital fiat which already exists and apps and with digital banking and credit cards.

Second CBDCs won't be very popular. Imagine the government launching their own social media platform to make sure that content shared complies with what governments think matters.

How any people would like govbook?

The government can't even launch their own healthcare website, thinking they will create  a competitive digital app is naive.

People don't use Bitcoin because they want to transfer money over the internet and it does  a better job than credit cards or paypal. They use it because they don't have credit cards, they want to control their own money, they want irreversible instant settlements, cross-border transactions and they want to protect themselves against monetary inflation.

CBDCs will be highly limited by KYC, likely restricted in many ways, have no privacy will be used to manipulated behavior, will be censored, have geographic limitations, will be highly inflationary and can be confiscated at any time and will not be an open protocol. CBDCs will be local and can't be universal internet money.

The central banks are deluded if they think they will be able to compete with a popular open source software.

CBDC will likely be used to send people money to keep the failing monetary system running and people will have an account to receive some cash. It won't be the currency of the internet,  a store  of value or  a place where people will put their wealth or something that companies build their business on. Just another stale government app.",Here is why CBDCs won't be a game changer and won't be a threat to Bitcoin,0.7

A trustless payment system that requires no 3rd party is quite frankly an insane human accomishment. If you dont think so then you are selling yourself short of a very important history lesson. Hundreds of them actually. Humans have been trying to accomplish this since the beginning of time. Poor countries are already seeing the benefits because it is improving their lives... these are facts that are indisputable so far. 

However, people who grew up swiping CCs and listening to elite media in rich modern countries require a little more thought power to grasp why BTC will slowly but surely become the money of choice. Also why this post will get downvoted by them. It's clearly not impossible to grasp in a modern sense, especially after reading a few books on the matter, but I totally understand how Buttcoin crew formed and why this is such a big misunderstanding of value that will take years and years to continue coming to fruition.

Since the dawn of man, anytime you introduce a better money into a civilization, that better money will end up becoming the standard. There is not other way to say that. Every money ever created prior to BTC either required trusted physical storage or was controlled and issued by a central authority. 

For the first time ever, that's not true. The reality is that we are not gaining any finacial freedom moving forward. None. The needle is going the other way. The value of USD and the other fiats that get watered down even more as a result of greed and power will become less and less valuable as they are held. 

I will say I did not understand BTC 3 years ago. I would have totally sided with the general unresearched public. It's amazing what a few books on the history of money will do along with a few about BTC itself. I think this is going to be a very slow change, but these things happen slowly and it's based on progress and innovation beyond every problem, not perfection of a globally accepted and purely trustless peer to peer monetary system in a handful of years. Let's review in 10 more years and see how different things are, considering there are more active wallets and more indovidual whole coiners than ever before as of 2022

13715,1670095726,False,"What we are beginning to see with energy production, in places like Kazakhstan and Texas, is using bitcoin mining as a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally, and then to use this value to trade between energy producers based on need. This will make energy markets more efficient, and make energy grids more resilient. You can produce at below peak times, and then buy at peak times with the bitcoin mined at other times. You can produce a sellable asset with waste energy and energy resources to offset the cost of production. This is fantastic.

But a less talked about subsequent effect of this that I (possibly naively) foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumers vs bitcoin miners (often the energy producers themselves). A time will come if this continues when an energy producer will ask ""what's more profitable, mining or selling the energy to consumers?"" and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin. How much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harvested with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for. Once this happens, bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reserve currency for bitcoin markets, the price of energy will become volatile as the price of bitcoin, and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin. *Bitcoin will become the unit of account in energy markets*. Once this happens I expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry as a unit of account over time and begin to be used as a unit of account for more and more markets, since energy costs are so fundamental to the costs of most other things. This phenomenon we are seeing now, the use of bitcoin mining to extract value from waste energy, will directly lead to Bitcoin being used as a unit of account worldwide.

I find nothing wrong with Ammous' core arguments and honestly I'm kind of alarmed by that. Is this everyone's response to reading these books? What do mainstream economists who read them have to say about them? For me to be like, okay he's right and go about my life, I have to think pretty much everyone in government is clueless.

The balance on exchanges has been steadily declining over the past year or two. If the trend continues in 3 years or so the major exchanges will have little to no Bitcoin left to facilitate trading and meet the needs of the buyers.

Factors that will likely shorten the timeline:

* We will have another having event in 2024.
* The current price just under $17k and likely to decrease in the short term
* It is becoming increasingly easy for people cross the world to purchase some

Factors that could lengthen the timeline:

* Off-exchange bitcoin being blacklisted by major countries

&amp;#x200B;

If this 'first great bitcoin drought' occurs the price is likely to increase substantially in a short period of time. I think this will be an order of magnitude bigger than previous bull runs because there was always enough bitcoin available via CEXs and DEXs. While I do acknowledge that there will be increased selling pressure when it hits higher dollar values I think it is unlikely this outpaces buying pressure in the long run.

Thoughts?

*Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. so that is around 11 USD at official rate and 10 USD at street rate.*

13900,1670202174,False,"I seem to remember every halving being approached with some trepidation as to how the miners would adapt. Historically, price goes up and more hash power gets turned on. Can this happen another 30 times?

In my simple understanding, each halving will double the cost of production. For most commodities, the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production. Assuming 30 more halvings, assuming a current cost of about $15,000 per BTC (which I think is a low estimate), this puts the bitcoin cost of production at ($15000 x 2\^30) or over $16T per BTC in 2140.

This seems kind of absurd. Especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay constant to what they are today in 2022. Given the trajectory of hash rate, it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in 2140 than in 2022. This would mean the cost of production is even higher than $16T, and the market price would need to be higher than $16T/BTC to support this. That would put the market cap at 21M x $16T or $336 Quintillion. Again, an absurd number as this is in t*odays dollars* (inflation would make this even higher).

Another possibility is that the hash rate reaches a maximum and then starts to drop off. If the difficulty is too high, miners will have to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty (and cost) to be under the market price. This would lead to centralization, or at least a reduction in the number of entities controlling the mining hash rate. 

I understand that at some point, most of the block rewards will be in transaction fees, but how does this impact the overall economics of cost of production? The fees are currently running around 1-2% of the block reward, though when the network is busy it has spiked to 30-40%. From what I can tell the fees will stay relatively the same in absolute BTC earned, but the coinbase reward gets reduced with the halvings. This seems like it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something like 100x what it is today. 

So this would put cost of blocks around $1.5M, and since that's for 6.5 BTC today... that would cap it around $9.75M cap to BTC? More realistic but not sure the math holds up...",Impact of 30 more halvings,0.72

step 1 - download Get In (good or bad name?)

step 2 - go to a lightning enabled website (such as [https://stacker.news/](https://stacker.news/))

step 3 - scan the QR code on the login with lightning section with the Get In app

step 4 - Accept

2. It is too easy to lose all your money. Especially people who value convenience over security.

* One/single BTC account
* \~100 UTXOs; various sizes
* All I want is to consolidate into the same account on the Ledger Live app/same address

Yes, it's better if people start really understanding bitcoin's value proposition and consciously start accumulating it, but this is tough - even most intelligent people I know are still dismissive of the idea and view it as a speculative asset.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

I see why people might view institutions role as counterproductive. Surely, an argument can be made that a big share of institutional money will go into paper bitcoin, which partially hurts bitcoin's value proposition of being able to self custody, and decouples real market cap from investment flows

But still, institutional money = big money, usually, =&gt; bigger market cap for bitcoin =&gt; more stable price =&gt; better value proposition as a medium of exchange =&gt; ability for network to grow stronger from transaction fees (as opposed to mining rewards, which are predictably diminishing)..

also more awareness - and sure, majority will still not understand bitcoin (at lease in the beginning) but some % will want to dig deeper..

&amp;#x200B;

on the topic of paper bitcoin that institutional money creates - yes this is bad, but it's just our responsibility to self custody, which I think most are already starting to do.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2:

The main point I see against institutional money flowing into the space is that it hurts bitcoin's main thesis - not relying on any third party to own and control your money. Therefore, we need only organic growth with proper education of the masses.

I am still not so sure that we need to be so categorical - I think still that any money inflow into the space is net positive force, creating more awareness, some of which will convert to properly educated people",Do you think institutional adoption is helping to grow bitcoin's overall adoption?,0.71

First of all, we need to create a bootable USB key with Ubuntu Server on it.

1. Download Ubuntu server ISO from here [https://ubuntu.com/download/server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)

2. Create a bootable USB drive. I'm using macOS, so I've used this easy tutorial: [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview) . If you are using Windows XP or later, you can use this tutorial: [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)

3. After having my USB key ready, I followed this tutorial to install Ubuntu on my NUC: [https://youtu.be/SXz-\_KEr9bE?t=167](https://youtu.be/SXz-_KEr9bE?t=167) or [https://youtu.be/xUH256WAWt0?t=191](https://youtu.be/xUH256WAWt0?t=191) ( **Do not install docker from the installer because you will have some errors when installing with snap** ). It takes about 10 minutes for the entire process. Be careful when you set up your partitions!

4. Reboot the system and run `curl -L` [`https://umbrel.sh`](https://umbrel.sh) `| bash` 

5. Log in to Umbrel, install Bitcoin and let it sync.

6. Install Lightning node

7. Relax.

I must say it has a very nice design, and I was pleasantly surprised to find Robosats in the App Store. It would be a nice thing if Bisq would be on Umbrel also.",Be your own bank! Self-host your Bitcoin full node with $200 or less,0.9

Use case: You want to self-custody and might be worried about viruses on your computer stealing funds, but spending money on a signing device and waiting for it to arrive is not something you prefer to do. This means not having benefits like a secure element, duress pin, and it is also more technical, but you don't have time to wait and need this done now and have hardware lying around.

14185,1670349915,False,"Hi guys,

I've been using Coinbase Pro for years now to buy BTC. Like an idiot, I've been ignoring the nag screens warning that Pro is being obsoleted, and that everything will be migrated over to a different product called Advanced.

I figured when the time came, the transition would be seamless. I've gotta say  though -- it's looking pretty ugly.

* The pages on the new site flip back and forth randomly between light and dark mode.
* None of my transactions appear except really old stuff back from 2015 when I first started accumulating, but prior to my migration to Pro.
* Spam on the sidebars shilling shitcoins, credit cards, and lending programs.
* Disturbing intermittent error messages along the lines of ""oops, something just went wrong, but don't worry, your funds are safe!""
* Links leading nowhere.
* Whereas Pro was a really clean experience, this new (old?) site seems cheap and clunky.

I'm not terribly worried about it. I never keep any BTC or USD on the exchange except during the small amount of time needed to deposit, place a buy order, and execute an immediate withdrawal. No funds are at risk. That said, the migration experience has been less than ideal.

**Has your Pro migration experience been any smoother than mine?** I'm thinking this might be the motivation I need to switch to a different exchange. I hear good things about Kraken.  If you switched elsewhere due to the sunset of Pro, **where'd you end up and is the grass greener over there?**

Thanks!

I've self-studied markets for years and with all the different catalysts lining up, have had a hard time understanding why the BTC/USD price has been artificially suppressed, specifically with all of the macro events / fundamental advances made.  The conclusion that I'm coming to is... manufactured paper bitcoin.  

I'm sure that most of you who read this understand that for every $1 a bank takes in, they can loan it out 10x.  This works for banks since there is confidence driven by education indoctrination, mainstream media, and lack of critical thinking.  A bank run on a large bank would completely destroy it as fast as FTX collapsed.  I believe this scenario is happening behind the scenes of a few other large (current) exchanges.  Until you've redeemed your coins and control your keys, the bitcoin that you think that you have in your account can be bought and sold to many other people simultaneously.  Therefore, the ""scarcity"" factor is invalidated.

The bad actors need to all be chewed up and spit out.  This is very good for the ecosystem.  I believe we will see a few more BIG exchanges fold before the end of the bear.  Only the bad actors will fall due to poor risk management and overleveraging their balance sheet (using paper bitcoin).   Protect yourself against the purge and self-custody, as I would hate to see honest plebs impacted (like the ones impacted by Celsius, FTX, BlockFi, Voyager, etc.)

\_\_\_\_

Hi,

I think the actual coinbase (block reward) is supposed to be 6.25 BTC but blockchain data shows it is always slightly above. It is not even monotic decreasing relative to block height.

* If the coinbase is greater than 6.25 BTC, why would miners grant themselves less than the maximum allowed value ?
* If the coinbase is less than 6.25 BTC, does it not break the consensus rules and why are nodes accepting all theses blocks ?

Thanks !",Why is the coinbase not a piecewise constant function ?,0.83

Every cycle countless users are led in by scams that pretend to be innovative and revolutionary and related to Bitcoin, and the platforms that make themselves vulnerable supporting them (even indirectly). Scams that are on the same platforms beside bitcoin. That are on the same wallets as bitcoin. That have the same name as Bitcoin. *Cryptocurrency*. That use the same ""revolutionary technology"" of blockchain.

This is the bear winter. It's on the back of one of the shitcoin collapses for the ages with mtgox. It's time to clean this culture up a bit and get back to the Bitcoin fundamentals and see if we as a community can lay the ground work for a safe and informed bull spring.

Run a node. Do not use shitcoin wallets and services. Always hold your keys. Don't trust, verify. That's the kind of adoption I'm interested in.

If you want to know how? Take all the time you need and inform yourself at [one](https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html) of many places but do so with a critical mind. Think ""who am I trusting and is it *really* that much work to eliminate that trust?"" Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. Price doesn't matter. Half these people are trying to rob you and no one is as interested in securing your money (or platform built on money) as you are. Just take your time. 

For others, maybe it's time we curate these resources and the advice we've been giving. It's going to take time and effort and a willingness to do it, but it is doable.

Let's verify more and trust less. Let's disassociate from ""crypto"" and stablecoins, or whatever that culture has become. Let's try to spread the highest quality methods, knowledge, and businesses. Not necessarily the most accessible and convenient. Not the ones paying us the most in yield or sponsorships.

I'm not under any illusion we're going to save anyone from themselves, and it'll never be close to perfect, but we can all do a lot better for ourselves and the people arriving in the community tomorrow than the low standards and advice regularly given in here. Than the companies we as a Bitcoin community regularly enable.

Anyone here is a bit worried about the bitcoin security budget?  
I am a 100% bitcoin lover and I feel like It has the potential to change the world economy and society.   
Anyway recently I heard about the risk that could happen in the future about bitcoin stability. It is an issue linked to the miners and their profit. Right now they get 6.25 BTC per block plus the transaction fee wich is something like 0.3 BTC. Next halving should not be a problem since it will be 3.125 BTC and so the halving after with a reward of 1.5625 BTC. Miners right now can easily pay off the electricity and hardware to mine bitcoin and they will do it without any problems in the coming years, with profit. But what about in the next  20-30 or 50 years? You would answer that the price of 1 BTC would be so high that even the smallest amount of satoshi could be enough for the miners to do their job. But we dont know that for sure, don't we? Plus bitcoin is influenced by the Nasdaq and SP500 and by the Government and central banks decisions, and ultimately by the world economy and its stability. Imagine a period of a big recession (statistically likely to happen in the next decades) what happens if the price of btc drops below the minum price which will make miners stop doing their job (since they get less and less btc every 4 years that minimum price is going to raise).

I lurk on this sub everyday and never post or comment, but I dusted off this auto-made account just to create this one post and then I'm gone again.

There has been a recent outpouring of hate toward some of the most popular hardware wallets (eg ledger and trezor) . These seam to be perpetrated by a few very outspoken commenters, but I'm concerned their narrow-minded views could gain traction. Basically, they posit that the only way to hold bitcoin is via an airgapped laptop or IF YOU MUST, a coldcard. Anything less than this is akin to shilling shitcoins because HW wallets like trezor and ledger allow shitcoin storage.

We need to be realistic here. If we are talking about resetting the financial system, then this means everyone will need to be able to use and store bitcoin safely. Are you really  proposing that everyone who wants to store their bitcoin install open source linux, figure out something like glacier protocol, roll dice a thousand times, and only use micro SD cards to store PSBTs? Like, seriously? Not everyone is a cypherpunk. What about people in the third world trying to outrun hyperinflation? Coldcards only? Come on, y'all.

The size of your stack and the duration of your time preference will dictate your security measures. If you are holding &lt;5% of your wealth in bitcoin, I would think trezor or ledger would be fine. That's how I started out when my stack was small. As your stack grows and becomes a larger portion of your wealth, you likely should upgrade your security measures. I use a multi-vendor, geographically distributed multi-sig solution now that bitcoin is a more substantial portion of my wealth.

I won't compromise on shitcoins. It's bitcoin or bust. But we do need to aggressively fight against this narrow-minded point of view that coldcards or airgapped laptops are the only solution for storage.

Some of the hardcore Bitcoiners among us are basically telling newbies that unless they're running their own node, with a custom built air-gapped hardware wallet, with multisig, with redundant steel plates of their seeds buried in a desert on each continent guarded by lions then they're idiots.

Anyone in IT security understands the idea that there is an inverse correlation between security &amp; accessibility. That principle goes beyond IT. For something to be 100% secure it would need to be **completely** inaccessible. It would need to be pinched off from our universe. 

For the vast majority of new Bitcoiners, a Trezor wallet (maybe running the BTC only firmware) is a perfectly acceptable solution. If purchased directly from the vendor and set up properly, they should be just fine. I am not a fan of Ledger, but even a Ledger would do. Small spending amounts of BTC  may be held on the Muun Wallet on a phone. 

Let's not scare everyone away by making this overly complicated. We'll never get mass adoption if people need to store their BTC in the singularity of a black hole.

Dangerous
- Leveraged 3rd party Exchange. using any exchange that offers interest on bitcoin means your coins are leveraged and not your own. They may not even be real. 

High Risk
- 3rd party Custody. Bitcoin kept on a large exchange. Such as coinbase. Coinbase go under so do coins. Most have not yet given 100% proof that they are not part of the leveraged group. 

Some Risk
- Self custody coins on a USB device and app, such as Ledger, if ledger leak information you can be identified or if you use a shipcoin on the device it may open it to hackers.

Low Risk
- Self Custody on a view only wallet like sparrow, use of cold card wallet or similar. 

Lowest Risk 
- an airgapped wallet. Use an SD card to make the transfer on a device then plug into the airgapped device for signature before using that SD card back on the network. Your key is never on the network.

Instead of using decentralised peer-2-peer Bitcoin exchanges where you support real Bitcoiners directly and receive ACTUAL bitcoin in return.

Bitcoiners using unsecure, shitcoin supporting, closed source self custody solutions with known attack vectors and no means to reproduce and verify firmware to factually prove with complete certainty that you have sole access to any Bitcoin stored on them. Who make concessions on security in the pursuit of profit-seeking. Risking sovereignty over your wealth. As opposed to using Bitcoin only, FOSS supporting, verifiably secure self custody solutions.

Bitcoiners running closed source, unverifiable Node operating systems that come pre-configured to the whim of the developers who produce them - effectively creating a node botnet where the developer has absolute control over what consensus parameters their army of nodes support. Obfuscating the purposes of operating a node to begin with - as a means to trustlessly validate and verify your interactions with the network itself. Instead of running a freely available, open source, personally configurable Bitcoin node software stack which with active management, protects your sovereignty on the network.

Whether deliberate or not - These attacks on Bitcoin stifle its sovereignty providing characteristics through verified property rights, rest control of the on &amp; off ramps and as an end result, effect Bitcoins potential for success and ultimately, its price. If you believe yourself to be a real Bitcoiner and find that any you are guilty of any one of these (as I myself have been) - do not assume that we bring them to the forefront because we want to make you feel bad. As individuals we gain no benefit from bringing these issues to light, other than the collective success of the Bitcoin network itself.

Stop trusting large, faceless businesses &amp; corporations to protect your privacy or your wealth. Their primary incentive is profit - and they will make concessions at your expense to achieve it. It is up to us, as individuals and as a collective of likeminded Bitcoiners, who truly believe in the Ethos that Bitcoin was built on ""don't trust, verify"" to stand up against them and make it be known.

14404,1670450705,False,"My humble opinion only.

Feel free to disagree.

Here they are:

**Level 1 - Muun Wallet (mobile):** Recommended for people that are starting out and don't have much knowledge about mnemonic seeds or how bitcoin works. User experience is incredibly minimalistic, almost idiot-proof. Backup process is intuitive as well. Comes with Lightning Network integrated behind the scenes. Fully open source. 

**Level 2  - Green Wallet (mobile):** Next level choice for those that are regularly stacking sats and have more understanding of how bitcoin works. Very modern UX and easy to understand. Has the ability to manage several wallets, passphrases, connect with TOR, connect to your own node, link to hardware devices like Trezor, etc.  I personally feel comfortable having up to 0.25 BTC here, but that's me. Your threshold might be 0.10 BTC or lower. Or it might be higher. On-chain only, no lightning. Fully open source.

**Level 3: BitBox02 Bitcoin Only Edition (hardware):** Once you're ready for a hardware wallet and have more money, this one is my favorite. The people behind this wallet are very transparent and security conscious. It's one of the very few wallets that protect against the covert nonce channel attack, which is a huge plus for me. The device is not difficult to use and the companion app is intuitive as well. Everything is fully open source. The only thing that I don't like is that their default backup option is an SD card. I prefer to discard the SD card and write the 24 seed word instead.

**Level 4: SeedSigner (hardware):** This is the best option in my opinion. It is completely air-gapped and uses generic hardware which drastically reduces the probability of a backdoor. The only downside is that it's a DIY (do it yourself) wallet. You need to buy the parts and assemble it yourself. Not the ideal option for 99% of people. However, if you're tech savvy and understand bitcoin, this one is awesome. Fully open source.

**Level 5: Multisignature and air-gapped laptops (advanced):** This one is worth mentioning. You will come across people that want to minimize trust as much as possible. They will say hardware wallets are not secure enough and will point you towards [yeticold.com](https://yeticold.com)  or [glacierprotocol.org](https://glacierprotocol.org). This is probably the most secure option, but it comes with a big tradeoff which is complexity. Consider this option only if you know what you're doing and have a LOT of money you need to secure.

That's it.

Hope you found this information helpful.

 The main event tied to these giant upswings is an event called ""The Halving"" where the free BTC given to miners gets cut in half, effectively reducing the inflation rate (the pure definition of inflation: increased supply of currency) to where the rate of supply increase is cut in half, and the demand ~stays the same, resulting in parabolic rallies. 
We only have a few more of these halvings left before there is no more BTC to be mined so I would suggest that you strategically take advantage of this cycle while you still can.

I tried out Bisq and it was quite successful.  I made some buys, made some sells and it seems like things work for the most part.  It has some bugs but nothing that does not eventually get resolved.

I had trouble figuring out Robosats.  I'm letting you know my mistakes so that you don't make them.  It was probably because:

1. I don't know how to use the lightning network so well.
2. I tried using electrum with their trampolines.

Here's how it went:

1. I got Tor and figured out how to run it.
2. I went to the Robosats website and found the Tor link.
3. I went to the Robosats site and I actually properly saved my bot.
4. I set up a small electrum trampoline channel for something small like 0.002 BTC.
5. I found a deal that I thought was reasonable and clicked on it.
6. I sent them my security deposit through a lightning invoice.  Now I have three hours.
7. I then tried to set up a few different half sized BTC channels that would not make the whole payment.  I didn't know that this was a problem.
8. I then learned through experience that the only way to pay the full invoice was to use a full sized channel that would cover the whole payment.
9. I made a new larger channel that would easily cover the whole payment.
10. I clicked pay for this lightning invoice three times and it failed three times.  Each of those times the trampoline tried to send eight times.
11. I lost my security deposit.
12. I'm in the process of closing my lightning channels.

Possible analysis:

1. Electrum is not that good for lightning.
2. Trampolines are not that good for transactions above 0.01 BTC.
3. I needed a way to practice these things and could not find one.

Any thoughts on what else we can learn?

14499,1670498056,False,"As you might know the Lightning network started back in March 2018 and serves as payment-layer to scale the transaction speed of the Bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time. Due to the lack of liquidity it was really hard to actually send payments at the beginning. While it became easier to participate in the network there are still challenges to solve in order to make it accessible for the broader mass. One of the main problems is the need to create an invoice each time you want to receive a payment. From a UX perspective this is absolutely horrible. LNURL and BOLT12 try to solve some of these issues which I will try to explain in the following part.  


# LNURL: What exactly is that?

  
LNURL is a stack of simple protocols for coordinating information needed to make payments over the Lightning Network using HTTP. The full list of LNURL protocol pieces can be found [here](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc), but I'm just going to go into a few core uses that overlap with BOLT12.  
The three core features of the LNURL protocol are defined as:

* *LNURL-auth*, where a public key can be used to log in to a service
* *LNURL-pay*, where a wallet can ping a server through a static QR code and retrieve an invoice
* *LNURL-withdraw*, where a wallet can ping a server and request that the server pays an invoice provided by the wallet

For using the authentication protocol the server provides a randomly generated number which the user's wallet signs with a newly generated key. After the server retrieves the signed randomly generated number the key gets saved and can be used for future logins.   


The invoice request functionality is a way to provide information to a user about a payment they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice. This provides a description of the payment, the minimum and maximum amount the service expects to be paid, and a URL for the wallet from which to request an actual invoice. From here, the wallet displays this information to the user, allowing them to set a final amount and request an invoice. After sending the invoice request and receiving one back from the server, the wallet verifies that the amounts match what the user set and pays the invoice.   
*(Note: This feature is already available if you're using Phoenix, Wallet of Satoshi or BlueWallet. Muun does not support it as of now \[December 2022\])*

The withdrawal request works by pinging the service, and receiving in response a description, a URL to send an invoice to, a random string, and a minimum amount and maximum amount that can be withdrawn. After filling in the appropriate value, the wallet returns an invoice to the server, and if it is valid and within the amount parameters, the service pays the invoice. The LNURL authenticate protocol can be used in addition to this to ensure that only the intended user can successfully withdraw using the LNURL link. Common use case would be if you want to withdraw your sats from a lightning service such as the lntipbot here on reddit or the lntxbot on Telegram.

&amp;#x200B;

# BOLT12: Why do we need it?

The term ""BOLT"" is the acronym for ""**B**asis **O**f **L**ightning **T**echnology"". You can compare these to the BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) which are design documents for introducing features or information to Bitcoin. The BIP, as amended, has since become the standard way of formally communicating ideas about potential Bitcoin improvements.  
As mentioned at the beginning of this post there are some UX flaws which need to be addressed. To understand the problems BOLT12 attempts to solve it is mandatory to have a look at the current standard which is used to create invoices, *BOLT11.*

Invoices generated by the BOLT11 standard consist of three main components:

* The destination where the payment is supposed to be sent to. (Public key of the node)
* The amount which is about to be transferred
* A hash which represents the payment secret  


The main problem of BOLT11 invoices is that they can only be used once and therefore need to be created in realtime. The creation of the invoice leads to the publishing of the payment secret and is therefore unsecure. If you would create an invoice with the same secret, someone could fraudulently request money due to the fact that the secret is known. This makes the usage of QR-code invoices for donations or other use cases impossible.  


# What is BOLT12?

BOLT12 offers an attempt to achieve some of the core functionality that LNURL provides without requiring the use of a web server. An offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payment, either a node\_id, or a [blinded path](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/route-blinding/proposals/route-blinding.md) (the last few hops in an onion route, pre-computed and encrypted) to that node using onion messages. It also can encode a minimum amount for a payment, the currency being paid in, an expiry time and minimum/maximum quantity numbers (for purchasing multiple items). 

This is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer. Someone who wants to pay an invoice does so over onion messages, one of the core features of BOLT12. It allows nodes to make a direct, end-to-end-encrypted connection between each other that does not involve a Lightning channel. Just like Lightning payments, these can be used to onion route messages. After obtaining an offer, a payer will use the information encoded in it to send an invoice\_request message. The creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice. 

There is also support for generating unique per user offers that allow the receiver to request a payment from the creator of the offer, similar to LNURL's withdrawal request feature. BOLT12 invoices commit to a unique payer key — this can be used in the case of issuing refunds to prove you are the person who actually paid the invoice. This can also be used in combination with the withdrawal offer to guarantee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator, as opposed to whoever is able to get a copy of the offer.   


# What's best?

Both LNURL and BOLT12 enable a more user friendly way for paying or getting paid on the Lightning network. While LNURL sits on the application level, BOLT12 provides a solution on proctocol level, where the new offers do neither require a web server, TLS-certificates nor a domain and provide a higher level of protection than LNURL. Using blinded paths the BOLT12 offers allow the confidentiality of the node-id, which additionally enriches the privacy. It's important to say, both solutions can exist simultaneously. While online shops and other service providers operate a web server anyway, LNURL is a good add-on. BOLT12 mostly addresses the endusers and offers a more convenient way to interact with the Lightning network.",What's LNURL and BOLT12?,0.96

14502,1670497554,False,"Hello everyone,

I am really loosing my mind on this. I am actually not a technical noob but also not the very best technican. But things like this should actually be very easy for me.  
What I want to do: I just want to connect my freshly set up Sparrow Wallet to my freshly set up Bitcoin Core. 

First of all, my setup:  
\- Bitcoin Core 23.0 on Windows 10, 64Bit (PC, local network)  
\- Sparrow Wallet 1.7.1 on Linux (Laptop, same local network)

I've set up Bitcoin Core on my Windows PC as usual and blocks are up to date.  
These lines were added to the ""bitcoin.conf""-file on my Bitcoin Core Windows node:

    rpcuser=user
    rpcpassword=password
    
    [main]
    rpcbind=127.0.0.1
    rpcbind=192.168.178.111
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
    rpcallowip=192.168.178.199/24


Where:  
\- ""rpcbind"" - is the local IP address of the Bitcoin Core node on Windows 10  
\- ""rpcallowip"" - is the local IP address of the laptop where Sparrow Wallet is running on  
The subnet mask is ""[255.255.255.0](https://255.255.255.0)"" so ""/24"" should be fine.

I've set up a few things like firewall rules and so on. **I've pressed on ""Test connection"" hundreds of times and it did not work** at all. **Somehow**, it **suddenly worked** and I got successfully connected to Bitcoin Core! I was really happy, **BUT: After closing the wallet and opening again, it again won't connect at all.**   
Again, I am getting the following **error message:**

&gt;*Could not connect:*  
 *Check if Bitcoin Core is running, and the authentication details are correct.*  
 *See* [*https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/connect-node.html*](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/connect-node.html)

I **noticed something really strange** as well:  
When I click ""Test connection"" on the laptop in Sparrow Wallet, even when Sparrow Wallet shows the above error, the **Bitcoin Core screen changes from ""You have no wallet loaded"" to a wallet that is named ""sparrow""** (in Bitcoin Core!) and shows ""0.00000000 BTC"" (I did not set up any wallet on Sparrow Wallet yet!).

I tried to do some research on this issue but it looks like I am alone with this and feel kinda stupid since I don't get what I am doing wrong ..  
I also **tried disabling the Windows firewall before connecting Sparrow Wallet to it without any success.**

Then I've **randomly found** [**this issue on Github.**](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/724)

I've tried the following workaround stated on the Github issue page:  
\- Shutting down Bitcoin Core on Windows  
\- Shutting down Sparrow Wallet on Linux  
\- Deleting a folder called ""sparrow"" in the Bitcoin Core directory   
\- Starting up Bitcoin Core again  
\- Starting up Sparrow Wallet again  
And TADA: **It works!** It says ""Connected to ""192.168.178.111:8332"". But only one time! When I close Bitcoin Core or Sparrow Wallet again, it won't connect afterwards. It gives me the above mentioned error again. **BUT**: When **I follow the workaround that I've stated above again**, it **works again (until I close Bitcoin Core or Sparrow Wallet and open it again).** So it **only works for a while when I delete the ""sparrow"" folder** in the Bitcoin Core directory.   
But only until none of both applications get closed. If I do so, I **have to re-apply the stated workaround**.

Other **strange things I've noticed**:  
\- When I do the workaround and are **able to connect Sparrow Wallet to Bitcoin Core, it does NOT show any inbound connection** (but Sparrow Wallet says ""Connected to.."")  
\- When I add ""disablewallet=1"" to bitcoin.conf, it does **NOT even work with the mentioned workaround** (even if it should as far as my understanding is correct)  
\- **When entering wrong authentication credentials on purpose,** it **takes some time until I get the error message** ""Could not connect"" - when I **enter them correctly, it shows this error message INSTANTLY!** I **got the feeling that it actually CAN connect** (since the **time until** the **error message** shows up is **less than a second**, **compared to** when I enter **credentials wrong** which takes **10-15 seconds until the error message** shows up)  


Can anyone tell me what the actual heck is happening here? That's one of the **strangest thing I've ever seen in my 20 year computer carreer**. Sure I could just to this workaround every time **but I feel kinda uncomfortable to connect/create any wallet with this strange issue being present.**  


I should mention that a VPN software is running on both machines. Anyways, it works when applying the workaround even with VPNs on (I've enabled the ""Local Connections"" options within both VPN GUIs). But it also does not work without following the workaround when both VPN softwares are completely closed and shut down. So the VPN can't be the cause of this issue I think.  


I really appreciate any kind of help!   
Is there any possibility that this is a serious issue by Sparrow Wallet and not my fault at all?

When you think about bitcoin, think about this message from Hal Finney,

“**The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them**. Unlike the world of today, where people are more or less at the mercy of credit agencies, large corporations, and governments.

Naturally, in today's society, with power allocated so disproportionately, such ideas are a threat to large organizations. Balancing power would mean a net loss of power for them. So no institution is going to pick up and champion these ideas.

**It's going to have to be a grass-roots activity, one in which individuals first learn of how much power they can have, and then demand it**.”

14572,1670527535,False,"Hello,

Isn't it quite simple to hack Bitcoin by simply generating trillions of random wallets offline and checking their content simultaneously? You just rely on luck to generate an already existing wallet containing x&gt;0 amount of BTC.

It doesn't matter how well secured/locked the random victim's wallet is since you are making an unencrypted/unlocked copy of it. I know the possibilities are huge, BUT I am taking about utilizing a super computer or just DDoS attack with millions of computers.

Even if this is now very unlikely to work such attack can be having a huge SCALABILITY. Has Satoshi Nakamoto thought about this in the long term i.e. 50 years from now? If someone succeeds in such an attack it would be devastating for BTC and all of blockchain/wallet related crypto, as generating a wallet while only being online means relying on a third party :)...

You could argue that the 51% attack is way more likely, but it's a public attack, so it wouldn't help. Stealing a wallet with literally ZERO hacking can be a GENUINE way to fight off any fraudulent claims in court since the ""hacker"" completely legally obtained the wallet via the official app :).

14576,1670526733,False,"So from what I've gathered there's multiple catalysts for Bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession(which is a fact at this point).

First one is the halvening(obvious). By the end of 2024 there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of 250k per Bitcoin. According to models that have a historical price accuracy of 90-99% Bitcoins value should peak at around 1m per Bitcoin in 2025-2026. Average recession lasts for around 10 months so by the time this one will be over Bitcoins price should be around 65k at the end of next year/beginning of 2024.

Second one is the GAAP-accounting standard. Next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value. Currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up. Starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a deal-breaker for institutional investors in the past.

Third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks, pension funds, central banks, small/big countries and different funds. Currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation/transparency/public disclosings. From the beginning of next year,(January?) The United States Congress will be having a session where the SEC and Congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules. They both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest.

The capital inflow should be somewhere around 1 trillion USD for the price to reach 65k at the end of next year. Current price would have to quadruple so approximately 1 trillion USD would be sufficient. Total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the US is 30 trillion USD. Germany has 2,62 trillion and UK &amp; Brazil and Switzerland collectively own ~4 trillion USD.
That's close to 37 trillion. If 3% of this would go to Bitcoin its price would quadruple. Another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect(5x) of investing in the stock market in which only 200 billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a 1 trillion market cap (5x200 billion USD=1 trillion). (I included Switzerland because its central bank has said it's interested in acquiring Bitcoin)

There's a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year (Big countries like Iran/Russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of CBDCs.. also Ukraine is one of the largest Bitcoin holders..) So there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession. The biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year. In addition to that revolving and non-revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of Americans is at an all time low.. if the recession will last around 10 months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to 250k per Bitcoin during 2024.

The third picture is Metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum 100k by 2025. It's not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value. According to this model the value would be minimum 1m USD during 2025 and hover above 1m until it reaches 10 during next decade.
These are just some thoughts, things I've gathered. Hope someone finds it useful.

14590,1670539976,False,"I ran my own Lightning node for over 1 year, so I have so personal experience with it. And the model works is it's simplicity, but I strongly believe that it sucks. The entire channel system sucks.

The main reason is how shit is it to actually have a node to spend. Unless you have a ton of sats to create a big channel to a place you will use frequently, you are gonna end up needing to reopen channels all the time and won't be any better off than using on chain.

This leads to the use of services like Loop, and those are both expensive and risky.

If you look at the trend too, centralization in Lightning is overt, where big nodes grow bigger over time, because they provide the least amount of jumps and the most usefulness for most spend user.

I honestly don't think the channel model is going to survive contact with hyperbitcoinization.

Edit 1: I don't think some of you are getting my point. Scenario: You get paid. Now you need to pay the bills. If you want to do this via LN you have to open a channel to your energy supplier for instance. Unless you have sats to open a channel worth multiple months of that bill, it won't be any cheaper or faster than using on-chain. And who is gonna have that? Multiple months of bills to put up front? Sure, if you want to budget a 1M sats channel for Starbucks that could work for a while, bu'r essentially LN forces you to ""pre-pay"" everything.
The solution for this is hiding all of this from the end user like Muun or Phoenix does. But you are then centralising the services and if you are doing that there are better theoretical solutions.

Edit 2: This is a legit gripe I have but the posting and phrasing was made volatile on purpose to see if it would survive being in the sub. Inspired by the ""Bitcoin sucks"" post about this being an echo chamber.

I just don't understand Electrum and how it interacts with everything. It seems like you can just not use Electrum and connect Sparrow to Bitcoin Core directly.

However, I have also seen people talking about setting up an Electrum server to talk to Bitcoin Core, which Sparrow can do anyway.

I messaged the mods of the cryptocurrency subreddit and asked them to enable lntipbot. They declined. They said they don't do tipping, well, except for moons, of course.

This meme says it all. It doesn't matter if people talk shit about Bitcoin. What matters is that people TALK about Bitcoin. Because whether they talk positively or negatively, Bitcoin will be mentioned and every mention yields awareness. In marketing, this is called a 'brand touch point'.   


It takes a long time for a new product until mass adoption happens. New customers first need to hear about, get interested, research and finally make a purchase decision. That doesn't happen over night.  


The first step before anyone can start his bitcoin journey is therefore awareness. You don't start your bitcoin journey unless you see Bitcoin in the news or hear friends talk about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As Bitcoin enthusiasts we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some point. Do you remember when you first heard about Bitcoin? You probably read an article that was shitting on Bitcoin and you dismissed it. You see, it's just NORMAL that bad news is part of the journey. But bad news is good news and here is why:

""The purchase funnel feels like it has been around forever. It is in every marketing 101 course book and is mentioned at least once in every client meeting. So when a client exclaimed, “it feels like we’ve used this thing for 100 years,” I decided to check.

Turns out, we have! Well, marketers anyway. 111 years to be exact. Whether you call it the customer funnel, sales funnel, marketing funnel, AIDA or just funnel, each serves the same purpose. The funnel shows how a customer ultimately makes the decision to buy a product.""  


Source: [https://medium.com/lift-pov/the-first-aida-diagram-still-relevant-today-e588c9151e80](https://medium.com/lift-pov/the-first-aida-diagram-still-relevant-today-e588c9151e80)

&amp;#x200B;

BAD NEWS is good news because it still helps Bitcoin. At the very beginning of the funnel is awareness. And bad news help to make people aware that Bitcoin exists.  


The Streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide, censor, or prevent access to something have the opposite result—the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing.  Here is a hypothetical example of the Streisand effect: Someone posts an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online. Around 100 people see it. The celebrity takes legal action to enforce its removal. Upon learning of the legal action, the media covers the story. As a result, millions of people seek out and view the photo. The upside: The celebrity will see the number of followers increase and his or her popularity rise following the news.

The Streisand effect is a great example of how trying to hide or prevent access to something can actually end up drawing more attention to it. This phenomenon can be seen in many different contexts, but one of the most interesting examples is the way that the media often tries to talk shit about Bitcoin.

At first glance, it might seem like the media's constant criticism of Bitcoin would be bad for Bitcoin. After all, negative news stories can often have a negative impact on people's perceptions of a particular topic. However, when it comes to Bitcoin, the opposite seems to be true. Every time the media talks shit about Bitcoin, it seems to only end up drawing more attention to it and increasing its popularity.

2. As an investment asset class ( Digital Commodity, hedge against inflation, dominantly regulated )

I recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub (and I think others). The great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips, or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar. You don't *need* to. 

If someone tips you 500 sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in 500 sats to it (that's the minimum tip). Then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else. No need to even set up a wallet! You can use sats all you want just from your own tips, get them and pass them on. 

I like this super low barrier to entry and want to help. So to save you the time setting up a lightning wallet (although I hope many already have and most will if not already), I thought I'd tip you 500 and you can pass that on to any other posts that you think are cool!

(Side note. You can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance, or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet. Just using the links on the bot reply)


Edit: Things to do next

1) Go tip someone else 500 and feel happy

14752,1670616475,False,"I hear a lot of mixed messages going around about the future of layer 1s and layer 2s. On one hand you hear people claiming, that in the far future, the bitcoin blockchain (layer 1) will only be used to transact millions and billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. 

On the other hand you hear people saying that lightning network (layer 2) is only for spending money and you shouldn't put more money on it than you would put in your wallet, and say you should keep the majority of your bitcoin on layer 1.

Well which one is it going to be? In 200 years will people be keeping their life savings on the lightning network and layer 1 will be reserved for million dollar transactions? Or will people still be storing a majority of their wealth on layer 1 and still use layer 2 for small amounts of money?

That WhiteHouse NSM-10 executively ordering whole-of-govt to migrate to quantum resistant cryptography will drive whole-of-bitcoin to do so, is it a must-to-do currently urgent BIP to do!

it's obviously a must-to-do for bitcoin migration!

2, 

Can bitcoin quite easily migrate to quantum-resistant?

[Andreas Antonoplous](https://twitter.com/aantonop) said on this video at 3'22"", “[bitcoin..can migrate quite easily to another algorithm,it's not really as big of a threat as people think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlzJyp3Qm7s)"", is totally different with what[Pieter](https://twitter.com/pwuille) Wuille have said:  [All practical (potentially) PQ schemes have massive keys or signatures, so it's not a free upgrade in any case.](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1133532067570933760)

3, 

Actually, there're only 3 types of quantum resistant digital signature algorithms even in future 20 years around. it imply to bitcoin have to be forked into multiple chains.

A. to use any one of lattice, hash-based signature, or multivariate, which is too big in signature size and/or public key, those future-forked bitcoins will have to be shift to PoS firstly, and then implement hash-based. as PoS consensus need few requirements in signature size and public key one. 

B. to use lattice, ""[Anyone considering lattice-based post-quantum cryptography should see this warning chart""](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker/status/1455269992161705984) it imply lattice probably get trouble in consensus.

&amp;#x200B;

Fr above, we believe bitcoin will be zero very soon as such future-forked bitcoin chains by using quantum-resistant algos above will lead bitcoin users to parts and parts, it probably cause the collapse of consensus!

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?","Bitcoin be zero before 2030s! forked to multiple quantum-resistant chains, lead to collapse of consensus, as per White House NSM10 have called whole-of-state for migration to PQC quantum secure. but all digital signature algos, even in future 20 years, are bigger sizes in either pubkey or signature",0.17

I Just made my first real transaction.  It was a small one.  Just trying things out.  I want to wipe the device and recover it to make sure everything is working and get familiar with the ui. I did it once before i transferred and the phrase worked so i figured that's a good start.  

The transaction only took a few minutes from start to finish so that was nice.  I wasn't expecting instant but I'm glad it wasn't hours like some people have said. 

When i made the transaction the provider said est fee was less than 25 cents when the wallet received it it said the fee was a lot more but i received the total amount and the first provider didn't withdraw more.  Is that common? What happened? Is the rest of the fee going to be removed/ taken later? 

Does the fee increase the more it is confirmed? 

Why on one page did it say the fee was much higher and then on another it says i saved on the transaction? 

I received it in the wallet before i got the transaction id is that normal? 

I looked at the transaction id it was in a batch or a pool.  Is that normal? 

I found my own part of it(very cool) but it said it was a used address.  How can it be a used address since it is my first time? 

In previous attempts the provider asked me to choose a network.  With this provider it didn't ask it just made the transaction which worked because i received it but does that have something to do with the different reporting of fees? 

The transaction amount was a lot more than i have. What happened here? 

There is a lot of information on my ''receipt'' ?  How much of that is vital? 
How much should i pay attention to? 
Are there specific things i should check everytime?
Any ids i should take note of? 

Its showing me a bunch of types and what looks like a bunch of different transactions? Is that normal? 

What determines the types? 

It only has a couple confirmations.  How many should it have?

How did i have it in my wallet before it was confirmed? 

This transaction was small tester one.  Should i make multiple small ones or fewer total?

If i make multiple transactions will it use a different address or reuse the already reused one that should have still had its digital cherry intact? 

I've been sitting here for far too long scratching my head.  

Is there a bitcoin for dummies type reference i can read? Like with everything?

""The premise of this attack is straightforward: a hardware wallet can leak the user’s secret key by carefully constructing its signatures. Since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation, even if the user verifies that her keys were produced from strong randomness, e.g., by generating her seed words by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallets to ensure they produce the same addresses, it is still possible to execute the attack.""

The solution Blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though. It involves trust in the manufacturer, and trust in the software if that software is closed source.  


The solution to this is much more obvious than this novel attempt to secure against it. The solution is open-source software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open-source hardware that is easy to verify via a visual inspection against a reference.

1. Target prices for hyper bitcoin range between $1-15 million.  That means that if you buy 0.001 bitcoin for what is now about $17 you can get your $1-15 thousand which will help you through the storm that will be hyper bitcoin.  It's a small amount of money and it will be worth it if that becomes the only thing your grocery store will accept.
2. People here can be jerks.  Many of them have been scammed by other coins.  I have wasted plenty of time researching garbage coins.  I have found nothing good.  This subreddit does not allow discussion of other coins and I think that is legitimate.
3. Do not buy any more bitcoin than you feel comfortable losing.  This is not a sure thing.  It will be very slow.
4. Bitcoin is a very very slow process.  The get rich quick stories are over.  The next people who will get rich quick will do it over a pile of corpses.  It will not be fun.  The lambos that you hear about will not exist at the beginning of hyper bitcoin because people will barely have the tools to put together the old used cars sitting around.  Pessimism will reign.
5. Learn about Central Banking.  Don't start buying large amounts until you truly understand how messed up it is.
6. Do not trade for the short term.  This is going to be a very volatile slog.

&lt;openai&gt;

Here is an example of a timelocked bitcoin output script, with the specified public keys and timestamp:

    OP_IF     
        OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP                 
        0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771 OP_CHECKSIG

    OP_ENDIF 

This script can be encoded into raw data using the following hexadecimal representation:

    63a914222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771ac68a914160945920088ac68 

The pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address for this script can be calculated by taking the hash of the raw encoded data and encoding it using the base58check format. The resulting P2SH address would be: 3LWcBvNyKeKjBwPtq3TBE8FNBvBx1RjK9s

The pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) address for this script can be calculated by taking the hash of the raw encoded data and encoding it using the bech32 format. The resulting P2WSH address would be: bc1qgj5sw943z46mj6y2vjywcw0j2lhxk8jn0xl4h4z4q3avjndy8e4nj6wcw6rx

In this script, the funds can only be spent if one of two conditions is met:

1. If the current time is greater than the specified timestamp (01Jan2023), the funds can be spent by providing a valid signature from the private key corresponding to public key A (0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771).
2. If the current time is less than the specified timestamp, the funds can be spent by providing a valid signature from the private key corresponding to public key B (03af054f050470b66846a0236d52df8471c6a1ea7d7cb5446fdcdaf4fbb6fb982c).

This script can be included in a bitcoin transaction output, and the funds will be timelocked according to the conditions specified in the script. The P2SH or P2WSH address can be used as the destination address for the funds, and the script will be executed when the transaction is processed on the Bitcoin network.",Building a timelocked script with openAI,0.88

14926,1670699865,False,"August 2020 I started DCAing when btc was around 10k. Minimum wage delivery driver. Put everything onto a hardware wallet.

January 2021 holdings already were mind blowing when it hit 25-28k. I discovered Celsius during this time. I removed all the money from my hardware wallet onto celsius, took out loans, redeposited the loaned crypto, and took out more loans against the borrowed crypto.

Kept delivering food, spent every dollar on BTC . Threw it into celsius and kept borrowing against the assets.

August 2021 Parents kicked me out of house. I had about $50,000 of btc and e. I didn't want to cash out because I thought it was going higher. So I lived in my car and continued delivering food. I didn't eat, and instead spent all money earned on BTC and put into celsius.

I lived in my car and delivered food for probably 3 months. 

November 2021, I had about $70,000 and a paid off car.

December 2021, 1 month after the top, I applied and got approved for multiple credit cards. I balance transferred probably $7,000 and bought the top.

January 2022, I had $6,000 in a Roth IRA. I cashed out of the Roth IRA and used all that money to put into BTC.

I learned how to use defi, and transfered some money out of celsius onto defi, and thought I was making money.

June 2022 comes around, Celsius runs with all my money. All I had left was whatever money I transferred to defi. I took that money, paid off whatever I could, and moved back in with my parents.

June 2022, I had 0 dollars invested. 0 dollars in cash. $5,000 in credit card debt.

July 2022 I continued delivering food trying to erase the credit card debt. BTC finds new lows, and I had no money to invest.

September 2022 I find a sales job and use the money to pay off the debt and DCA into BTC.

December 2022 I get fired from the sales job for not hitting the numbers but I leave debt free and with 1k cash and 1k dollars worth of btc.

Today, I am back to delivering food living with my parents with no debt, but only 1k cash and 1k dollars of btc to my name.

It is the bottom, only up from here, and I am scrambling to try and get back to where I once was. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get to the BTC stack I once had.

&amp;#x200B;

Lessons learned:

I will only buy bitcoin from now on in terms of currencies.

I will only use a hardware wallet from now on.

I will try to learn to spend money from now on so I don't see $70,000 melt away for nothing.

I will try to learn to diversify just a tad bit more so that way the pain isn't as bad during bear markets.

I will try to resist balance transferring my credit cards, but I truly can't promise myself that I won't do this again in the future, because I really might. (I want to do it right now because I'm convinced we are in a macro bottom)

I will not rub it in people's faces during bull runs and instead try to be generous to other people. During the bull run, I let everyone around me know (friends and family) that I was right the whole time, I outsmarted everyone, I was too good for a regular job everyone that thought they were better than me can never catch up to me, etc etc. Which was a big mistake and now I am the biggest clown during the bear market. 

Now I think being generous to people in your close network will build trust, and their trust is a valuable asset, so it's like diversification in a way.

I will try not to watch too many crypto Youtubers. I will admit that watching them did make me money, but it also lost me money. I will try to watch only the quality YouTubers, but also not only watch just 1 or else I might fall into an echo chamber.

I will try not to stare at charts too much anymore. During the bull run, I would refresh prices like i was checking social media.

I will not talk to any friends or family about bitcoin.

I will put some money into a Roth IRA but I will not take it out like last time. But I will still invest a majority BTC.

I will try to find a job so I can buy BTC","In November 2021, I had $70,000 at 21 years old. In June of 2022, I had $0 and $5,000 in debt. Here's how I did it.",0.93

You could tip people on Twitter, which didn't really catch on. It goes thru 3rd party etc. Reddit also has karma which is incentive for quality. CC (who of course rejected the LN tip ability when it was offered this week) has Moons which is built into the sub and and you get issued Moons based on post and comment performance etc. This was pretty cool and they have actual value, but it's automatic issuance, no one actually decides your post's worth based on their perspective.

In comes these Lightning tips. This is not a platform that invited some kind of payment system for helping people based on individual user's opinions. BTC and Lightning's techincal abilities mixed with a market's demands allowed this medium of exchange in a typically non-market place to come to fruition by simply using a bot to capture commands and communicate with Lightning. It it can be used almost instantly as buying power for anyone with a Lightning capable wallet. 

This is as simple as a technical ability meeting a requirement of the free market. This isn't some Moons getting distributed, this is someone deciding ""Hey, I found this helpful or funny or whatever"" and I want to give this complete stranger, from anywhere in the globe, REAL WORLD spending power, instantly.

15039,1670740501,False,"I’ll preface by saying I’m not an FTX user but I do have my theories about what happened.  The fact that money was being sent to Alameda instead of FTX to me means the scam was planned from the beginning.  What im unsure of is whether the money was stolen or lost on bad trades, im guessing it’s both.  I have some suspicions I wanna throw around here I figured this would be the best place to get feedback on it.  The main thing I feel people reading this needs to understand is I believe Sam planned to use FTX as a crypto slush fund form the beginning and it was always a scam which leads me to the following:

As I understand it FTX had a lot of derivative, futures, and leveraged products.  These products track the price of an underlying asset and can be complex.

To me, it’s quite a stretch of the imagination that FTX was actually taking all of the underlying positions that you could take on the platform if he was gambling with everyone’s money anyway.  I don’t even know how you’d accomplish some of it in crypto.. so was that a scam too? Any FTX users on here that can comment?

My question is essentially do you think SBF was letting people place bets on the price of tokens without there actually being any underlying transactions?

Cause if that’s the case then it makes sense why he deleted everyone’s balances and trade history and I’m also wondering if you were able to go on FTX with a small amount of collateral. Place a ridiculously leveraged bet, get it right, and cash out your money?  Whose money was that got cashed out?",How big was the FTX scam?,0.6

*As you know I'm Venezuelan living here and have been posting this for almost 5 years now.*

*Exchange rate went crazy from around 13 Bs. (Bolivares) per USD to 18 Bs. per USD. Official rate is around 14 Bs. per USD.*

*So devaluation and inflation, more BTC trading.*

*Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs.*

*As I always say, this doesn't mean this is the total volume traded in the country, just traded in LocalBitcoins (which is not much used anymore). Kings of exchange/trades are Binance, AirTM, Reserve and others.*

*LocalBitcoins had a volume over 2000 BTC years ago.*

*One BTC trades around 315,000 Bs.*

*Goverment has removed 14 zeroes from the currency. One current Bs. would have been 100,000,000,000,000 ""old"" Bs. So one BTC would have been 31,500,000,000,000,000,000 ""old"" Bs.*

*People use crypto to avoid Bolivares, get paid, pay thingsm exchange profit from mining (electricity is ""free"") and also receive remitances from abroad.*

*Any question, let me know.*

r/LNTipBot2  for more official information. 


-------non wallet use---------



You can start right now without set up!! (You just need someone to tip you)

I recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub (and I think others). The great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips, or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar. You don't *need* to. 

If someone tips you 500 sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in 500 sats to it (that's the minimum tip). Then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else. No need to even set up a wallet! You can use sats all you want just from your own tips, get them and pass them on. 

(Side note. You can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance, or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet. Just using the links on the bot reply)

To tip type !LNtip 500 (or any number higher than 500). It will tip the person you are replying to. If you don't have the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet. 



---------use with a wallet------



Setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot.

A great guide from Double-LR (tip him if he posts in comments)

I use muun too so you are in luck. It works a very small bit different than you think. I am on a phone so this is what I just did to transfer 5000 sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet. Very easy. You’ll see. Prior to doing this you must have the wallet fully set up. Get your seed phrase words (aka your keys) and write them down and keep them safe. Then do the rescue/emergency pdf thing too. It’s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out. After that…

1. Open muun and select “receive” 

2. At the top there are two option buttons. Select “Lightning” and the screen will change to a lightning address

3. At the bottom you will see “Invoice Settings” select that and you will see a button to “add an amount” and an expiry time for the invoice. 

4. Press add+ and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance. Press “confirm” and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created, an invoice for the amount of sats you entered. 

5. Press “copy” and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone. 

6. Open Reddit and Find a tipbot message, it has the blue links in it, you see it every time a tip is given. Press “withdraw” and it will create the DM format for you. (Once you learn the format, very simple, you can create it from scratch like a normal DM but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own) 

7. On the DM page created by the blue link, there is a spot that says “put_invoice_here”

8. DELETE only that simple phrase, and then paste in to the same spot, and your invoice you copied earlier will appear. The line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is. 

9. Press send. 

10. Open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from Reddit. 

11.  Enjoy, fellow redditor. 

It seems like a lot. But I’m reality steps 1-5 will become 1 step for you and steps 6-9 will also become one step for you so once you learn it it’s basically two steps. 

Lightning is badass. Enjoy, fellow redditor.



-----------General Help --------



Some useful FAQ type information not included on the bot website. If you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to Google the gaps in your knowledge:

- what is bitcoin?  It's a digital commodity. Like gold but much easier to transport. 

- what are Sats? Each bitcoin is made of a 100 million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier. 

- what is lightning? The bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure, great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network. It allows you to send sats super fast and cheap. 

- what is a bot? An automated service to help you. Don't worry about sending messages to it, as long as you don't change the words it's just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately

- do I need a wallet? Perhaps not... You can be given tips and then check your balance here on Reddit and only tip others using your tips. A great little circular community. 

- but then I do need a wallet? Yes. When you either have so many tips on your Reddit LN Bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet. Or if you have no tips and want to tip then you will need a wallet. 

- what's a Reddit LN Bot account wallet? The clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet (just for use with the bot only) attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tips and balances. Smart!

- what's a lightning wallet? A lightning wallet (probably) an app that you can install. The app allows transfer of bitcoin/sats to any other wallets. Great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin, sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l, and for sending sats to fill your tip account. 

- where do I get a lightning wallet? When youre ready to use one, Google it, and find one you like 

- anything else to know? Only one last bit. If you tip more than you have availabille, or you try to make a deposit (clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot) then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and enter into your lightning wallet app to make a payment. When you do.... You will have used bitcoin! And passed a tip to someone else. How nice of you.

I just want to inspire this subreddit with a interesting thought I got a few weeks ago.The question I wanna discuss today is:

# ""In times of rising surveilance: Do you think that Non-KYC-Bitcoins will have a higher price in the future compared to KYC-Bitcoins?""

""Why should Non-KYC-Bitcoins should be more worth at all?""Let's say you want to buy Bitcoins and you meet someone for a P2P trade (i.e. from Localbitcoins):An attacker (i.e. governments) could try to blackmail the seller of the Bitcoins to force him to reveal the identity (or at least distinguishing features and data) of the buyer.This sounds weird and exaggerated - I know - but take a look at the last 2-3 years.Please don't get me wrong.

I was and I am still kinda hyped and amused by how LN could be THE scalability solution for Bitcoin. It is just so versatile and fast and it actually works like a charm for me. I fucking like using it BUT

The thing is, with lightning, users are not able to easily run a node and take custody of their funds, lightning does not promote decentralization and without decentralization we are not talking about Bitcoin.

I personally have my lightning sats on a custodial lightning wallet and I think that's the case for almost every LN user. That is not the way, on chain-BTC is easy to have in self custody and a Bitcoin full-node is something everybody can run in their house as it has little to none maintenance required. On the other hand a lightning node is some complicated shit which only some hardcore enthusiasts can run properly.

These recreations all focused on the idea of Bitcoin as a technology, when in fact, even the technology used to run Bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus.   


Take Robux for a minute. Robux is a popular digital asset issued by the Robux corporation. It has exchanges (though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the Robux corporation). What is the functional difference between Robux using an SQL database between their servers and Robux using a private blockchain where only Robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer? Its still permissioned, Robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accounts, and Robux is still sold by the Robux corporation.   


Crypto is much more akin to Robux in this way. Crypto is not subject to the whims of its userbase, it is only subject to the corporation behind it.  


Bitcoin does not work in this way. Bitcoin is a social construct. The Bitcoin core devs have done a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software gets through, but what would happen if they did?  New rule, block sizes will now be 10gb instead of 4mb. The first problem they'd run into, is that the new software is not compatible with the software everyone else is running. People who run the software would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly, and fork the project into a new repository.  


You now have two chains, but which chain is ""Bitcoin""

So that's what I mean when I say Bitcoin is a social construct. Any argument you'd make over which gets to be Bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct. The current construct around ""what is Bitcoin"" is that the chain that is compatible with the older software gets to be Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

""Wait but the original Bitcoin github repo gets to be Bitcoin!"" I hear you scream. So lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run Bitcoin. When you use a Bitcoin wallet and you don't run your own node, you use the node that software wallet defaults to. Now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that Bitcoin is the core repo, but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that Bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the software. In fact, it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client was even released. I mean I can't help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version 23 of core even though version 24 was released.   


Miners and price. I can't talk about the role that miners would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners. If users prefer to use one chain over the other, its price will go up which makes miners want to mine that chain instead of the other one. This means the chain that goes against the users wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports user decisions. Being part of the dominant monetary network has its perks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand. Right now, the strongest social construct for money, is that government issued paper is money. Bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own.","Bitcoin is a Social Construct, not Crypto",0.62

I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. Anyone heard of this?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",Known Mining Integrated Appliances?,1.0

15276,1670796198,False,"*tl/dr; Between February and June of this year, I took out $35,000 in unsecured personal loans with an average fixed APR 5.5%. I boughtt 1.7 BTC at a cost basis of \~$20,500. I've since paid off $8,000 of the loan and currently owe $27,000. Even though I'm down \~17% on my investment (not including interest), I'm not stressing and my conviction remains strong. I can easily afford to service the debt.*

&amp;#x200B;

As promised, here is my 6 month update... 

&amp;#x200B;

***How it started....***

Two ***unsecured***, ***fixed APR*** personal loans for $35,000 total.

First loan was February 2022 for $15,000 with a ***6% fixed APR*** and a monthly payment of $225 on a 84 month payment plan. I bought 0.45 BTC with a cost basis of \~$34k.

The second loan was in late June for $20,000 with a ***4.9% fixed APR*** and a monthly payment of $326 and a 72 month payment plan (In the original post I said my APR was 4.5%. That was a typo, it's actually 4.9%). From this loan, I eventually ended up with 1.25 BTC with a cost basis \~$16k.

***Total Amount of Bitcoin: 1.7 BTC***

***Total Cost Basis: $20,500***

With Bitcoin trading at \~$17,000 that puts me currently at -17% on my investment.

Current amount owed: $27,000. I've managed to pay off $8,000 so far.

Original total monthly payment to service the loan: $551. However, since I've paid off so much in such a short amount of time, they've lowered my monthly payments from $551 to $480

&amp;#x200B;

***How it's going?***

I'm doing fine. I've been laser focused on paying off the loan as quickly as possible. I managed to pay off more than I thought I would by now, \~$8,000. Making the monthly payments has a been a non-issue. I'm thinking I'll be able to pay off another $12k-15k in 2023 or more. We'll see...

I'm not upset with my cost basis either. It would have been much higher were it not for a good trade during the late summer rally. I originally had a higher cost basis like $19,500 for the Bitcoin I bought with my second loan. However, I did what I said I would not do: I sold it at in early August for just over $23,000. I held on to the cash for a good two months, and then bought back at a lower price in October-November.

I know I said I wouldn't trade, but I just couldn't believe this past summer rally. It was too obvious a suckers rally. Bitcoin ended up going over $24,000 so I'm happy I got close to the top. I know, I know. I shouldn't have traded but I did and it worked out this time thankfully;-)Moving forward, I'm going to continue stacking sats and paying down my loan.

This is meant to be a long term hold for me, 5-10 years, if not longer. I took out a loan that I can easily afford to service, so it doesn't matter what happens in the market.

Nothing has changed in my view of Bitcoin. In fact, since the collapse of FTX and all the others, my conviction in Bitcoin has only grown stronger. I keep everything in cold storage now. I can't imagine ever touching another alt coin or holding my coins on an exchange ever again...

It takes a minute of open-mind reading to really understand this.  
This strategy is called ""Goldengale"", because it is similar to Martingale strategy but utilizing the Golden Ratio of life (1.618). Every drop to 0.618, you increase the purchasing weight at that level by 1.618. So if you bought Bitcoin for 1000$ at $69k price, you next Average Down purchase would be for 1618$ (1000 \* 1.618) at $42,642 price level (69000 \* 0.618). The beauty behind this, is that no matter how low price goes, if you buy in these levels (0.618, 0.382, 0.236, 0.146, 0.09 ........) by multiplying the purchasing weight with 1.618 every time it reaches those levels, your Break-Even level will be just one Golden Level above your last purchase. Everything beyond that is PROFIT.

For more, check the Excel sheet...

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text in the sheet

""Goldengale"" = Golden + Martingale

Every **drop to 0.618 level**, you **add 1.618 weight** from previous purchase. **Break-Even** price will be one Golden level above our last purchase.

So in this scenario, if we buy Bitcoin in ""Goldengale"" fashion, if we bought all ""Golden levels"" in Goldengale fashion, and if our last purchase is 11089.01$ at 6220$ price, our Break-Even level will be one Golden level above, at $9533.4

And if we close all of our position at $100k price, our total profit will be 260,146$

15396,1670848939,False,"Bitcoin Vs. Michael Burry: Investing in Freedom

Michael Burry (A.K.A. “The Big Short”) is so cool. 

Except he’s not, actually.

Most people know Michael Burry for predicting market crashes like the great financial crisis in 2008. Because he’s been successful in predicting downturns in the market, Burry has been christened “The Big Short” of the financial markets. But I’m beginning to think that his new nickname should be called “The Big Slave Owner.”

In fact, he’s a sadistic, egomaniacal, psychopathic slave owner who doesn’t care about anything but making a return on what he feels will be the best investment that the free market will allow: Slavery. 

Sometime in the Second Quarter of 2022, Michael burry bought more than 500,000 shares of The Geo Group (GEO) – a private prison operator. GEO Group was the only stock he held as of the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Most of the (emotionally detached) financial analysts and journalists will find reasons to justify his slave-owning position. They will say something like, “a recession is possible soon, so this investment makes sense.”

Because it does make sense. An increase in crime is directly correlated with a lack of job opportunities in a particular area. So, if job cuts continue to rise in America, there will probably be a slight increase in the crime rate in the United States. 

But, Investing in the deliberate disenfranchisement of other human beings is the worst type of investment you can make. This isn’t about the ROI. This isn’t about the progress on your quarterly statement. This is about investing in the empowerment of The People or in the enslavement of them. When has investing in slavery ever been a good idea? 

In America, the land of the free, it costs about $50,000/per year to house a prisoner. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather be investing that type of money in the next generation of technological advancement. $50,000 can get you 3 bitcoin, which is an absolute bargain and a much more sustainable long-term investment than “prison labor.” 

Bitcoin is changing the way we value traditional services that were available to us; this includes  accounting, auditing, and our civil rights. Bitcoin is the quintessential asset that allows any human being to become their own sovereign bank. By owning bitcoin, you unchain yourself from financial institutions that control your money.  In a world where people invest in slavery to gain a yield on their depreciating dollar, bitcoin is freedom in the form of money fighting back for your God-given rights. Despite ROI degenrates like Michael Burry, bitcoin is lighting a path for all humans that are debt slaves to a flawed monetary system. And that makes the world a better place.",Bitcoin Vs.

 In this little Tutorial i will show you how to create your own true random wallet seed phrase.

First of all there is no extra Security with this, a True random generator on todays wallets (Exodus, Electrum etc.) work just fine. But if you have troubles believing the computer generated seeds and you want to verify the randomness of your own secret key words this Tutorial is for you.

**How does it work ?**

The Seed number is encoded into a 12 or 24 english word combination, so how difficult is it really to get true randomness ? Well a human ain't do it thats why the best choice is the dice, some nice premium grade casino dice will just do fine.

We can roll 23 out of these 24 words, but the 24th one can not be rolled yet? why you wonder, the 24th word completes the whole Key, the last word is dependend on the first 23 words but i'll go into further detail below.

Get your **dice (5x)** and the [word list](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/BitBox_Diceware_LookupTable.pdf) and start rolling. (and you need a **coin**, a bitcoin does not work out, you need a physical one)

* Roll the Dice and flip the coin.
* Arrange all dice (1-4) into a line, pick them from left to right (and top do bottom if in doubt)
* Reroll all dice that show a 5+ until they show a 1-4
* Put the coin next to the dice

https://preview.redd.it/jz4r41srzj5a1.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e32e7c8af7fe2f8d9ac1f4c06f9b4f7666939144

Pick your word

* the first die gives you the page number of the word list
* dice 1 to 4 give you the correct row
* and die 5 + the coin will determine the correct column
* repeat until you have 23 words

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oi1nvvguzj5a1.png?width=9304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146a3a797b88c53afcc9a55acc40ad3f0f2d7a92

&amp;#x200B;

Now its time to finalize your wallet.Choose your wallet of choice and recover it with a seed phrase. Fill in your 23 words and the wallet will display 8 valid words to complete the checksum. Pick one of these words, again randomized!!Now you have successfully created your own random seed Phrase.Confirm the Phrase on your wallet of choice and you are god to go.

~~Now it's time to brag with your new seed Phrase post it on Social Media and share it with all your friends~~

As a BTC maximalist and the credibility I have in Bitcoin is enormous, I am absolutely sure that for the younger ones it will be the way for them at the age of 18 not to need their parents to pay for their studies and help their parents at that time . This is going to be my ""crazy"" uncle's offer because I have these very ""bold"" ideas, especially for those who don't understand anything about these technologies. My request goes as follows: I needed to get a kind of paper wallet for each of them (the parents) to keep so that they can make use of it one day. I've been reading and [https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) doesn't inspire me with much security because I've already had a problem with scamming money from wallets and leaking wallets. The purpose of this message is to ask everyone if anyone has any idea how I can safely make these 11 paper wallets to give them to all of them. I apologize for my English, but I think you get the idea.

Im curious about the PASSPHRASE WALLETS, 

\- Is a Passphrase wallet any different from the naked wallet? in a sense that lets say, I give my address, there is a way that someone could identify ""this wallet is under a passphrase""?

\- If someone is able to access my Seed or ""jackpot"" it, will this person be able to determine if my Seed phrase has a Passphrase wallet inside? I do know that some passphrase can be cracked as soon as minutes or days, But in order for ""hackers"" to do this, they need to know that in fact there is a wallet hidden in there, isnt this right?

There are several potential ways that Bitcoin could benefit Africa. Recently, Jack Dorsey was instrumental in leading a $2 million seed investment into Gridless. Gridless designs, builds and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa where excess energy is not utilized

Bitcoin will provide financial services to people in Africa who don't have access to traditional banking systems. This could include allowing individuals to store and transfer value, make online payments, and access credit. Providing banking services to underserved communities enhances the overall world economy. This could lead to more economic opportunities for individuals and businesses, as well as increased economic growth and development.

By providing access to a global financial system, Bitcoin could help African countries gain greater economic autonomy and reduce their reliance on other countries and institutions. This could give them more control over their own economic development and allow them to better respond to global economic challenges.

Furthermore, Bitcoin and other digital currencies have the potential to support entrepreneurship and innovation on the continent. This could include providing funding for start-ups and new technologies, as well as creating new business models and opportunities.

Providing a stable store of value: In African countries like Nigeria and Zimbabwe, the local currency is unstable and subject to inflation. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to save and plan for the future. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is  not subject to inflation in the same way, and can provide a stable store of value. 

In order for people in Africa to benefit from using Bitcoin they will need to have a basic understanding of how the protocol actually works. Bitcoin could create opportunities for education and training, helping to promote financial literacy and build human capital on the continent.

Sooner than later, Bitcoin will help stabilize the African economy. All of the diamonds in the world come from africa. Now, Africans have the capability of using their “diamond hands” to take the continent to heights taller than Mount Kilimanjaro. And that makes the world a better place.",Bitcoin Vs.

Today we will take a closer look at bitcoins maximum supply.Most of you think it's 21 Million right ? Wrong.

With a bit math I'll try to explain to you why and how the BTC halving takes effect on the maximum supply.

The time to mine one block is about 10 Minutes.60 blocks per hour \* 24 hours per day \* 365 days \* 4 years is about 210240 blocks.

so about every 4 years we see the halving.

The Block reward started at 50 BTC per Block. So in theory 50+25+12.5+6.25+3.125+...... = 100

But there is one problem BTC has only 8 decimals, if a halving is about to create a 9th decimal it's just cut off because of the code.

Therefore we can calculate this:

|*halving*|*year*|*reward till halving date*|*BTC supply total*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2012|50|10 500 000|
|2|2016|25|15 750 000|
|3|2020|12,5|18 375 000|
|4|2024|6,25|19 687 500|
|5|2028|3,125|20 343 750|
|6|2032|1,5625|20 671 875|
|7|2036|0,78125|20 835 937.5|
|8|2040|0,390625|20 917 968.75|
|9|2044|0,1953125|20 958 984.375|
|10|2048|0,09765625|20 979 492.1875|
|10-31|2056-2132|0,04882812-0,00000004|20 989 746.0927 - 20 999 999.9706|
|32|2136|0,00000002|20 999 999.9748|
|33|2140|0,00000001|20 999 999.9769|
|34|2144|0|20 999 999.9769|

So the maximum is not 21 million bitcoin but 209 999 999 769 000 satoshi. or

Two quadrillion, ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-seven million, and six hundred and ninety thousand Satoshi.

Some interesting facts

* more than half the bitcoins were mined till the first halving
* the first decimal cut is at the 10th halving from 0.09765625 to 0.04882812 btc
* during the last 30 years (2110-2140) there will be less than one bitcoin mined in total

Just like Bitcoin!

Niche small adoption. No country running 100% on it. Noticeable on the web.

I think this is where Bitcoin's future lies, it won't be adopted widely, things won't be pegged to it. Listen to Jeff Snider explain money and you soon realise Bitcoin lacks the elasticity to be a base currency. Lightening network maybe is a solution but so far I've not heard / read that the technologically is ready.

I think bitcoin will still be around for years to come, but will just be a niche currency, used mostly by...  nerds..  like Esperanto.

Some categories on my radar:

**Heaters**  
I'm aware of [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) as a space heater option. Pricey upfront cost but the energy usage is equivalent to other space heaters so any time it's on you essentially mine Bitcoin for free. Still, even with constant usage of the heater it will likely take 3-4 years to pay off. You'll likely end up with more Bitcoin just buying and holding right now.

Any other heater companies, or contractors working on a more integrated heating solution for a home or office? I came across a [video by Wilson Mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w8YNBPFKJc&amp;lc=Ugxp76HP0AQgaBYYzyR4AaABAg.9jYZWcFxe9g9jZKLIUyOvP) where a customer of theirs built out home and pool heating himself so it's definitely a viable possibility (at least in some situations).

**Hot Tubs**  
I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. I could even see just a portion of machines in a laundromat have mining and you would give a slight discount to incentivize that one being used first (so as long as some customers are drying those are likely running).

Anyone heard of something around this being pursued?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",Known Mining Integrated Appliances?,1.0

I'm fairly new to how Bitcoin works, and with everything that's happened recently, it's no surprise I'm in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges, but I'm trying to understand more of Bitcoin works under the hood as I find the tech fascinating.

I withdrew all my funds from FTX (thankfully on time) and more recently Binance and chose Trust Wallet, as I found their ""multi-coin"" wallet from a single mnemonic an interesting idea and the app looks and functions great. The only downside is that there's no way to access some of my wallets from the extension, so I went with Electrum to get my Bitcoin address on my computer.

Here's where my big confusion lies: when I imported my wallet from the mnemonic, I got a bunch of wallets, the first one being the one Trust Wallet gives me (I assume that's how HD wallets work). However, when converting my BIP39 mnemonic to a BIP39 seed, importing that seed in Electrum still works, but I get [completely different addresses](https://i.imgur.com/nvZ81dP.png). Is there any logical explanation to this? A friend of mine suggested maybe Electrum does something to the seed, but that possibly can't be the case I'd hope?

As a side question, somewhat unrelated but I'm also wondering, when I created a wallet on Trust, it gave me the mnemonic as it should. Maybe I'm too skeptical but, how is Trust supposed to know it can't give the same mnemonic to someone else? How is it made sure that no other user from any other software / hot wallet app will ever get the same mnemonic as me?

Thank you for your time to anyone that can help me understand those!

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I know I will get scammers and whatnot in DMs, I won't reply to anyone in DMs so no need to tell me in the comments if that can spare you some writing :) I'm also aware I showed my balance in the screenshot, it's there to show that the left window (imported from the mnemonic) does contain the wallet Trust gave me, and that the right window (imported from the seed) does not.

15857,1671003461,False,"Bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not, use a light wallet or not, a company node/wallet or not. You also have to decide who you will give your business to, and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with Bitcoin services.

With that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of Bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers.


**The Low Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers. This is the gold standard of Bitcoin service. Examples include lightning routing, lightning liquidity marketplaces like [pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/), [coinjoins](https://nixbitcoin.org/orderbook/) like [joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), [coinswaps](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions), submarine swaps like [loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop/) and others.

When at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run. Many services and contracts, in Bitcoin or layers, will claim to be low trust - even decentralized (which isn't all necessary for a business, they are supposed to be centralized!) - but very few are. Ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible. For example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will. You have responsibility (watch the blockchain) and recourse (publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance). The risks revolve around your own capacity, time delays locking up your coins, and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody.


**Trust The Service Will Be Provided**

This is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided. Pretty normal, you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction. Examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin, the merchants using [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) and non-custodial exchanges like [bullbitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/). This is also a very good model with limited risk, but often little recourse.


**The Federated Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure. It's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests. Examples include [Liquid](https://liquid.net/), [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) peg, Multisig custodians, [BISQ](https://bisq.network/) escrow. These services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other.  The risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited, include custody, and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all.


**The First Party Custodian**

This bitcoin service relies on only itself. It often prides itself on this self reliance, boasting a lack of third parties and self custody. [River Financial](https://river.com/) is a good example. If you can trust the one business, these can be quality services. They can also be horrible rug pulling scams. The risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service, but only trusting one party. As with all custodians at and below this point the correct answer is don't use a custodian.


**The 3rd Party Custodian**

This is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian, like [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/). Examples include [Strike](https://strike.me/) and [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/) among many others. While both are Bitcoin only companies, the custodian they rely on holds [over 70 shitcoins](https://www.primetrust.com/qualified-custody). These kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold Bitcoin only companies, but on [closer inspection](https://strike.me/faq/bitcoincustody/) you will find they don't self custody - a central tenant of a good Bitcoin participant in the space, user and business alike. This can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk, even if it's not just custody. For example [Kraken just leaked user data](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yz85kg/psa_kraken_breach_of_security/) via a Zendesk leak. This is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and I make these specific examples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself - are you trusting them or a tower of service providers? Other Examples on the more severely negative end of this description include lending platforms like Blockfi and Celcius, where the tower of third party dependency extends through custodianship and lending and other abusive business models. These businesses can run the gamut from moderately acceptable to horrible run for your life - depending largely on the complexity of the tower of 3rd party dependency and the severity of risk each party exposes you to.


**The Shitcoin Casino**

This isn't a Bitcoin service at all, it's a public harm. These are exchanges which service and host scams, exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin. They often print their own shitcoins. They lure users in with too-good-to-be-true fees. They should be avoided at all cost. Examples include FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, KuCoin, and many many others. Most others. I won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them.

**TL;DR:**

As you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use, what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to, and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space - consider all your options. Not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust. Consider minimizing your exposure to this ""contagion"" and not only get off exchanges and custodial services, but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place. Avoid shitcoin custodians and services. Use lower trust solutions. Let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how.",Trusting Bitcoin Services and Businesses,0.81

I'm looking for the best Bitcoin wallets for Android/iOS an thought here might be a good place to ask.

Android:

1. BlueWallet (Open Source, Lightning support)
2. Samourai (Would be 1. but it's still in alpha stage officially. Open Source, Coin selection)
3. Blockstream Green (Open Source)
4. Electrum (Open Source, buggy experience with it sometimes why it ranks lower)

So we already have micro CBDC’s in the form of social security benefits, ebt, disability income, among other government subsidized programs. CBDC’s would basically be the United States dollar, except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a CBDC. For example, there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy (You probably won’t be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a CBDC. If you are, it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon, or something parental like that).  

Bitcoin is important because while a CBDC is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy, the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted, no matter what. Imagine an international bank that never closes and audits every transaction every 10 minutes to ensure the validity of the network; that’s bitcoin. 

Jerome Powell controls the price of money, so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world. The issuance and regulation of CBDCs by central banks could give governments too much control over the flow of money in the economy. 

This could allow governments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights.

Another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of CBDCs could make it easier for governments to implement harmful monetary policies, such as negative interest rates. Negative interest rates can have detrimental effects on the economy, including reducing the incentive for individuals and businesses to save and invest. 

Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world, whereas CBDCs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders. 

This makes bitcoin a more attractive option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries.

The use of bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that transactions can be made without revealing the identity of the parties involved. This can provide a higher level of privacy and security than transactions made using a CBDC, which would be subject to the same regulations and oversight as transactions made using fiat currency.


CBDCs may be perceived as a positive change in the financial system, but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions. Bitcoin offers a permissionless, decentralized, and everlasting alternative that gives users more control over their own funds and provides greater privacy and security. And that makes the world a better place.",Bitcoin Vs. CBDCs: SpyCoin Coming soon,0.75

At that time I very much had two mindsets. 1) As a libertarian, anti-FED computer programmer, I *finally* fell in love with the beauty, simplicity, and transparency of Bitcoin - God knows why it took me so long, but it probably is related to the second point. 2) I definitely at the time was in a betting/gambling mindset where FOMO was a big motivation, and this tendency is likely why I ignored Bitcoin for so long - I assumed I had “missed the boat.”

So this leads me to today. In the last year, I put most of my savings into Bitcoin and I DCA’d a a solid 15% of my take-home pay as well. I would have more USD value had I just saved in cash (like I had been doing for a couple years prior). Yet, I have no regrets, and I want to say why.

I was lucky to have a mentor in Bitcoin who both stoked the flames of my passion, but also constantly reminded me of the core principles and goals of Bitcoin, and he would say “please, only put into Bitcoin what you can afford to lose.”

I took that advice, though I was a bit liberal with the definition of “what I can afford to lose.” But still remained within the bounds of no regrets. While I put a LOT into BTC, I maintained a substantial emergency fund in USD, I did not completely ignore my 401k, and never once did I have to sell any Bitcoin.

I have transitioned from wanting the price to go higher for my value in USD to go up, to wanting the price to go down to be able to buy more BTC, to finally not caring what the price is and stacking regardless.

This is the only asset in the world that will keep its scarcity. I’m just glad to be able to obtain any amount of it without putting the rest of my life at risk.

16019,1671055600,False," Lately I have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain. I was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush, but like many I stayed because I really believed in the future of crypto. As this bear market has progressed, I have been filtering through the junk. As I dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology I am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility. Here are a couple of my opinions. I would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything I say with evidence. 

Possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions. This is especially useful for large payments and international transactions. The problem is there no easy way to convert Bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange. The argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency, but we are still far from there. Needing to rely on exchanges to convert Bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with. At the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers. 

The second issue I have is with linking tokens or NFTs to physical goods. Despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions, since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible. I often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain. Assuming a QR code is used to track certain items the QR code can always be removed or recreated. It would also rely on always scanning the QR code to track it. If the code is not scanned, then the transaction will never show up. In the case of digital items like NFT Art it costs so much energy to upload Medidata on chain that it is not feasible. Most NFTs rely on Medidata servers to store the NFT which makes the whole point of having a Blochian pointless to begin with. You can’t hide the Medidata for confidential documents, you don’t own the copyright to the NFT in a legal sense, and you can’t prevent anybody from copying the Medidata you “own on the blockchain”.  

This leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented. Aside from the obvious pump and dumps, even ""legitimate"" projects do not offer real world value. It seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing, transacting, and living more in the digital world. Most projects assume one day their project will be useful. While that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a Ready Player 1 style world. I don’t know of any projects except Bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could.

To summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in today’s world. I still love the crypto world and I want to believe in it, but I am seeing less and less a true use for it. As I take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me.

Y'all should see how concerned is binance emailing and texting me from sms, asking me to return fast and grab the gifts they have for me, otherwise my account will be deactivated. More than 3 emails daily. Since more than two months. Begging me to return to binance and verify my account.

Guess what? I didnt verify it, i didnt care about getting my account deactivated and they still send me emails and sms telling the same every other day, like i only can do withdrawals now or come back fast and grab this gift from us or verify your account and blahblahblah.

I really dont care about my binance account, i have nothing of interest on it and i will not delete it because in order to do that i have to log in again and verify my account, which ive already done two years ago. They look almost desperated, and if i was an actual user, definitely i wouldnt trust that behaviour from a bussines or platform where my money is at.

Im aware if binance goes bankruptcy could be the beginning of the end to crypto, but you know what? F*** Binance. F*** ChenPeng Zhao or however its written and f*** all exchanges. While we are here for our own risk and profit, they just want our money, increasing the risk to us, but none of them risk absolutely nothing from themselves. They want our money so they can play their games without losing anything more than our trust.

 Im starting to think in order for crypto to win, and for us to win with crypto, intermediaries need to lose and disappear. Wasnt that the reason why bitcoin was created for? 

Ill give you another reason to boicot exchanges. People create shitcoins trying to get rich, instead of investing on whats really profitable.

A few months ago, I was traveling abroad and I found myself in a situation where I needed to exchange some money into the local currency. I didn't have any cash on me, and I didn't want to deal with the fees and hassles of using a traditional bank or exchange service.

That's when I remembered that I had some Bitcoin in my digital wallet. I was able to quickly and easily convert my Bitcoin into the local currency using a Bitcoin ATM, and I was able to complete my transaction without any fees or hassle.

This experience really highlighted the power of Bitcoin and its ability to enable fast, secure, and convenient financial transactions. With Bitcoin, I was able to bypass the traditional financial system and exchange money directly with another person, without any intermediaries or third parties.

But that's not even the most exciting part. By using Bitcoin, I was able to complete my transaction without revealing any personal information or sensitive financial data. This anonymity and security is a game-changer for anyone who values their privacy and wants to protect their financial information.

In short, Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the way that we handle money, and I'm incredibly excited to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology.",Anecdote traveling abroad,0.71

We're excited to announce the launch of **MinIT**, our new heating solution that uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat. With our unique technology, you can reduce your dependence on fossil fuels and save on energy costs, all while participating in the Bitcoin network.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ui74d5ayc36a1.gif

MinIT is equipped with a domestic hot water calorifier with a volume of 120 liters, and it incorporates hot water storage capable of storing up to 10 kWh of energy in the form of heat. It can convert over 90% of the heat generated by the mining server into domestic hot water, up to 70°C.

Connected to your existing heating system, MinIT produces additional electrical heat on demand, reducing the consumption of your main heating system. It's an easy and effective way to make the most of your existing heating system, and it's mainly aimed at reducing the consumption of fuel oil and natural gas.

**But why is MinIT the best heating solution out there?** Here are a few reasons:

* It's **smart and efficient**. MinIT uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat, making the most of the energy being used. And with its hot water storage system, it can provide additional heat on demand, reducing the need for your main heating system to run as often.
* It's **environmentally friendly**. By reducing your dependence on fossil fuels, you're helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. And by participating in the Bitcoin network, you're supporting a decentralized and renewable energy-based system.
* It's **accessible and affordable**. MinIT is easy to install and can be integrated into your existing heating system, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for heating your home.

If you're interested in learning more about MinIT, [check out our website](https://minit.tresorio.com/en)

or shoot us a message. We're happy to answer any questions you might have.

I’m also an environmentalist, and that is the biggest reason I became a Bitcoin miner. It was the only feasible way to invest in green energy formation and storage technology and make it profitable enough to be able and continue to develop more solar and battery farms 

Thanks to Bitcoin, we might actually have enough solar, wind, and battery farms one day to rid ourselves of the dirty energy production companies.

The irony that so called environmentalist today bash Bitcoin, while it does more to create the infrastructure we needed to achieve 100% green energy production and storage one day than any other industry, is astounding

If you move Bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then I understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and knows how to get in.

But if you move Bitcoin to, say, an Electrum wallet and save the seed phrase (on paper somewhere or in your head), and then you delete the Electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to get hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it.

So what really is the difference or pros/cons of the 2 approaches?

Of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it. But like ETHW, people will know they can sell it and get “fee” money.
You have 5 BTC so you received 5 BWEF, trading each for 300$. 1,5K for free ! let’s dump it quick !So you wanna swap you BWEF on a website for $. Free money houray !In order to do this you have to send your BWEF by creating a transaction and signing it.You then sell and get your dollars.
So you got your 1,5K$ for a shitcoin you didn’t want anyway. That’s just a win right ?But here is the issue: your transaction is public and is also valid on real BTC chain.
SO now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain. This could be the buyer of your BWEF.Now the buyer as received your BWEF and your real BTC. You’re sold your 5 BTC for 1,5K$.


So now let’s talk about how to protect from this. Afaik there is no way to protect from what I just describe. The only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains. Which can be difficult because most people don’t use their own node. So when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain.So if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me, share infos like how to protect or anything, please do.I think this would help greatly community.",Replay attacks on blockchains,0.64

16213,1671152082,False,I’m looking to open a couple of online poker accounts to start playing the bankrolls I’ve set up. Through minimal research I’ve downloaded “Strike” as my btc market. From what I’ve read people say the fees are very low. But I’ll welcome any input on that as well. Where I’m really struggling is with my choice of wallets. When the bitcoin boom was first kicking off I used coinbase but I was not  happy with the amount of fees with each transaction. And with the poker sites having their own fees I want to keep the ones associated with my wallet as low as possible. And smooth transfers to my bank account are preferable. I don’t mind paying a decent price for a good wallet. Any suggestions are very much appreciated. Thank you.,What is the Best Wallet for my Situation?,0.75

As a fellow believer of Bitcoin, I’ve been hodling away and a bit of a lurker on here. 

Anyways, I run a small app development business, and I have a developer overseas who I pay crazy fees to transfer salary to each month. 

And I thought, why not just send payment with bitcoin? It’d be cheaper, and faster? 

Though I have a rough idea on the way to do it, I’m not sure if it’s the best way though. 

Here’s my plan. On the day of payment, send fiat to the exchange. Buy Bitcoin at market price and send it immediately to my employee. Hope that he (if he wishes) exchanges to fiat asap to avoid fluctuations in value.

\- When you book and get services, this are really cheap, usually $0.25 per ""item"" giving you a total of like $15 for a full Veterinary treatment.

Should I start using the BC1 receiving address on my hardware wallet? Also for what I already have in the legacy address, should I eventually make a tranfer to my BC1 address o  tje same wallet? (The wallet support legacy, segwit and native segwit).

Trying to understand what is the best practice here.

Thank you 🙂

BTC represents Hope!!

We major tenants as well as the new and future BTC Maxi's believe that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse a little, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. This is the future for a world of peace and civility for our planet. This is what is necessary for our future generation's survival. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, but allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.

BTC Dystopia:

We never said that BTC is without flaws.

* It won't be easy watching as most of the brick and mortar banking institutions shut their doors because they are not needed as much anymore.  
* It won't be easy watching our military forces budget reduced by half or more.
* It won't be easy watching a full hour of TV without seeing a pharmaceutic ad.
* It won't be easy watching that abandoned building on the corner transformed into a food service bank for those who have nothing and are hungry.
* It won't be easy watching that other building adapted to a free medical facility for those who have less.

Let's say an exchange allows you to transfer only 0,05 BTC daily.

So you have to send X times, every day the 0,05 BTC to ultimately transfer your funds from the exchange.

Is it better (fee-wise) to:

a) transfer those funds to the same address X times,

or

b) transfer each day to a different and NEWLY created address (no previous history)?

I'm asking because I read that later on, the fees would be lower if you're sending from X different addresses (same wallet), which have just the history of 1 previous transaction vs sending from one address which has the history of all the X transactions.

Apparently it's less space consuming (?) to check the history in the a) case than the b) case, hence less fees to be applied.",Fees cost when transferring from 1 address with history of X transactions vs from x,0.87

16417,1671228844,False,"Since the rejection of hard money and the transition to fiat money, which is created out of thin air by the government, the relationship between a government and its people has drastically changed. 

The dependence on the government’s ability to print money has created an unbalanced master-slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily subsidize the government’s money printer. This reliance on government printing has effectively removed the accountability of public entities as they no longer work for the people, but rather the money printer. 

The government’s ability to endlessly print money without repercussions means that the people no longer own their government. The lack of checks and balances in the system has caused public entities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations, Wall Street, foreign nations, and the military industrial complex for extra money, similar to a side hustle for a paycheck. This creates a conflict of interests, as the people no longer own their government, and the government is now working for the money printer, not the people. 

This is why there is such a disconnect between the government and the people these days. The people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard, and this is due to the government’s reliance on its money printer. Public entities are no longer accountable to the public as they only strive to please the money printer. 

The good news is that there is a solution to this problem, and that is bitcoin. By creating a decentralized monetary system, the people can take back ownership of their government, as the money printer no longer holds the power. Bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom, as the government no longer has the power to control the money supply. Furthermore, it creates the transparency that the government and the people need in order to work together. 

In conclusion, since the transition from hard money to fiat money, the government has become a master and the people have become its slaves. Public entities are no longer accountable to the people, as they now work for the money printer. However, with the introduction of bitcoin, the people can once again take back ownership of their government and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two parties.",Who works for whom?,0.82

A Great lesson relayed by Mike
 Harvard Business School 101
 
Not long ago a merchant found a lot of monkeys that lived near a certain Village.  One day he came to the Village saying he wanted to buy these monkeys.  He announced that he would buy the monkeys at $100 each.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers thought that this man must be crazy.  How can somebody buy stray monkeys at $100 each?
&gt;
&gt; Still some People caught some monkeys and gave it to this merchant and he gave $100 for each monkey.
&gt;
&gt; This news spread like wildfire and People caught monkeys and sold them to the merchant.
&gt;
&gt; After a few days, the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys at $200 each.
&gt;
&gt; The lazy villagers also ran around to catch the remaining monkeys. They sold the remaining monkeys at $200 each.
&gt;
&gt; The merchant then announced that he will buy monkeys for $500 each.
&gt;
&gt; The villagers start to lose sleep.  They caught six or seven monkeys which was all that was left and got $500 each.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement.
&gt;
&gt; Then the merchant announced that he is going on holiday for a week, but when he returns, he will buy monkeys at $1000 each!  He also said that his employee will be in charge, and would take care of the monkeys he bought pending his return.
&gt;
&gt; The Merchant went on holiday.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers were frantic and very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell at $1000 each as was promised by the Merchant.
&gt;
&gt; Then the Merchant’s Employee contacted them and told them that he would secretly sell them some monkeys at $700 each.
&gt;
&gt; The news spread like wildfire.  As the Merchant promised on his return that he would buy monkeys at $1000 each, they would achieve a $300 profit for each monkey. The next day the Villagers queued up near the Monkey Cage.
&gt;
&gt; The Employee sold all the monkeys at $700 each.  The rich bought monkeys in large lots.  The poor borrowed money from money lenders and bought the rest of the monkeys.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers took care of their monkeys and waited for the Merchant to return. However nobody came!  Then they ran to find the Employee.  However he was not to be found.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers then realized that they have been duped buying the useless stray monkeys at $700 each, and were now unable to sell them.

16506,1671275740,False,"The global economy has been under a monetary policy for the past 100 years that has empowered central banks and puppet governments to get richer while  
 ""retail"" individuals and businesses have become poorer and more ignorant of the suppression of this global power. These central banks and governments   
manipulate the exchange rate for their own benefit, rather than helping the people. If you are not familiar with how central banks and governments operate,  
 it is worth doing some research. A simple Google search for ""fractional reserve system"" will reveal that if a bank has £1000, it can ""lend"" out £9000 at a   
specific payback rate of x%, depending on the bank.  
  
We believe that central banks and governments control everything because we, the ""sheep,"" don't look into these things. Their jargon is too difficult for us   
to understand, so we just think that we don't understand. But if we are capable of running our own businesses - shops, barbershops, bakeries, lettings agencies,  
 gas stations, farms - and producing more wealth than governments and banks, why do they control the middle man who ""does"" the transactions and ""says"" they are legitimate?  
  
Before 2008, we did not have a system that could legitimately take control away from the middle man and his ability to make the rules of money or dictate the value of the   
currency we use. But now, with the emergence of Bitcoin , we have a system where a 1:1 value can be achieved and cannot be changed. 1 Satoshi will always be worth 1 Satoshi.  
 At the time of writing, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately $16,800 in fiat currency. This means that with $168 in this Bitcoin economy, you would have 10000000 Satoshi.  
  
Let's say we use a 1:1 ratio and, as a farmer, you charge 3, 4, or 5 Satoshi for one egg, plus a network fee of 1 Satoshi (which would not be necessary if we did not use the exchange   
rate dictated by governments and banks). If all energy suppliers adopted this 1:1 ratio, then food suppliers could do the same and use this system instead of relying on the fractional reserve system, where they have an unfair advantage at a ratio of 1:9 without actually producing anything, thereby devaluing the actual currency.  
  
As a producer, which would you prefer: being paid the same amount for your goods and services today, tomorrow, and in 100 years, or giving banks the power to dictate that you must pay   
more to produce and charge more for your products just because the middle man wants to take a share? The adoption of Bitcoin gives individuals and businesses   
the potential to take back control of their financial transactions and reduce their reliance on traditional financial institutions. However, it's important to be aware of the risks and  
 challenges associated with using other types of cryptocurencys.  
If all 18+ aged people understood how the economic system works and how Bitcoin works, they might choose freedom over a ""fiat asset"" that is essentially worthless. Fiat money, which is issued and controlled by governments, has value only because people agree to accept it as payment for goods and services. But we have no control over the supply of fiat money, and governments can print more of it at will, which makes it cheaper.  
  
On the other hand, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and miners. In order to make any changes   
or improvements to the network, these nodes and miners must reach a consensus of at least 91%. This means that anyone who runs a node has a say in any changes or improvements to the network.   
In contrast, traditional banks are opaque and have no accountability to the public. We have no idea how much money they have, and they can continue to print more even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy.  
  
The current economic system, based on fiat money and controlled by a few powerful banks and governments, is flawed and ultimately leads to homelessness and hunger for many people. The value of money is constantly decreasing,  
 and $100 today might only buy half of what it did even two years ago. By adopting a decentralized system like Bitcoin, we can empower ourselves and take back control, making our own decisions about what our time and effort is worth.  
 Instead of blindly accepting the value that the current system assigns to fiat money, we can use a true 1:1 system where everyone can see and validate the worth of their contributions.   
It's time to stop thinking like sheep and start taking charge of our own economic destiny.

Could we not be capable as retail to produce and service ourselves using the network.

Big whales they could easily buy out power company's and start delivering energy and get paid in Satoshi, price the energy in Satoshi and use excess energy for mining or securing the network, the same with farms. a Bitcoin whale could buy out and teach farmers what Bitcoin is and how it can benefit them, we have to engage producers or make ourselves producers and make our own Bitcoin standard and prices.

With todays tech and possibilities could we not set our own ""retail chains"" from producers to client and leverage the network to our freedom. 

If any one is a producer and if we can get producers from all types of industries in this talk and please feel free to do so. We can truly make a better world of we put our efforts to it.",Read and decide do we want to be sheep or do we truly want to evolve and better ourselves???,0.56

Since 2000, banks around the world have had to pay more than $340 billion in penalties for violations of rules in the financial services world. The reasons for these violations are varied:

* Mortgage abuses.
* Fraud.
* Toxic securities abuses.
* Investor protection violation.
* Economic sanction violation.
* Consumer protection violation
* Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
* Anti-money-laundering deficiencies.
* Banking violation.
* False Claims Act and related.
* Foreign exchange market manipulation.
* Price-fixing or anti-competitive practices.
* Interest rate benchmark manipulation.
* Tax violations.

Here’s a great article of that the Dunning-Kruger effect is: https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740

What I’ve started to realize with those that are into “crypto”, is that many people overestimate their own understanding of Bitcoin. They think Bitcoin’s 10 minute blocks are a problem, not a positive that enhances security and allows for massive decentralization. They think that proof of work is not necessary and that bad ideas like proof of stake make sense. Hey! They can “stake” and get a return! They don’t understand the security that comes from proof of work and that staking leads to centralization, security risk, censorship, and many times those with the most coins getting the biggest vote. 

Often, I’ve seen engagement with people who don’t know better and who may be suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect, and we go only one inch deep. We respond with high level details, or not respond at all. It can be tiring explaining something that’s not so simple, but I think giving the details is important. It helps people realize that they don’t really know much about it. 

I had an acquaintance that thought he knew Bitcoin and he was not a fan. Through discussion I learned he had some big misconceptions and really had no idea how Bitcoin worked. I literally white boarded Bitcoin for him, and then gave him the book “Thank God for Bitcoin” because it aligned to his faith and is an easy read. He’s a self custody bitcoiner now, and just last week I helped him with his first lightning wallet.

Say, the cost of mining one BTC is 1.5 BTCs in the relative fiat currency?  If miners drop out, and transactions cannot be validated, the relative exchange value of BTC is thus 0?  Since no exchange can take place.

Is there something I'm missing here?  This seems like a weakness inherent to PoW crypto, especially BTC, which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining.

Further, I cannot think of a real world counterpart, since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it.  In fact, as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity.

I'm sure I'm missing something, since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an investment vehicle, at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges/transactions.",Question concerning solvency of Bitcoin.,0.67

I’m up to the chapter that contrasts a spend-thrift with a saver and the obvious benefits of being frugal. It describes how “Benjamin” saves half his capital in a bank, which then lends that money out to help other business start up etc. 

But that got me thinking, how does that work with Bitcoin, which the mantra is “Not your keys, not your coin” and thus as we all should, I have my BTC locked up in a hardware wallet. But that’s it… it’s locked up… it isn’t earning interest. It isn’t helping “the economy” by being lent out to other startups.

So basically, things will cost less and less bitcoin, and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than 1 sat.

Although you have eliminated some privacy concerns by running your own node (or connecting to someone’s that you trust), others remain. If your wallet software is connecting directly to Bitcoin Core, you are using Bitcoin Core’s wallet internally. This is true not only for Sparrow in this configuration, but always true for Specter, FullyNoded, and of course the Bitcoin Qt wallet itself. **Unfortunately, Bitcoin Core stores your public keys and balance unencrypted on the computer it is running on. If this computer is regularly connected to the internet, it is at risk to hackers - which will make you a target once your balance is discovered.**

If this is a concern to you, consider running an Electrum server, which does not keep any record of your balance, but indexes all Bitcoin transactions equally.

**Downloading the entire blockchain is the most private way to operate a wallet.** All other lightweight solutions leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers.

[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)

The  price action along the path to $1,200 was intense. In the year 2013, we  actually had 2 bull runs. One in March 2013, from $10 to $260, and one  in the winter from $100 to $1,200.

he posts this to complain about how bad of a trader he is:

""It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.""

He  was completely drunk and shook. He was dissing on the so called  successful traders who claims to buy every bottom and sell every top  perfectly.

He wrote in the post:

&gt;I  type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.    Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I   HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader andI KNOW I'M  A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and  the lows  pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino  bucks  sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S  GOING  DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY  ASSHOLE  when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy  back in  but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the  traders buy  back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO  YOU'RE  CHEATING day traders NOT ME\~!  Those taunt threads saying ""OHH  YOU  SHOULD HAVE SOLD"" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I  SHOULD  HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE  EVERY BUY  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only  sell in a  bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned  noob.  The  people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this,  traders can  only take your money if you sell.

Home robbery

On the evening of Thursday, June 24, 2021, the doorbell rang at the home of the declarant [victim] (hereinafter: declarant) at the [street name] in Leeuwarden. There were three men in green KPN jackets at his door. They said they were there because of the upstairs neighbor's fiber optic cable having a malfunction. And that cable would also run through the meter cupboard of the declarant. 2 One of the men suddenly pushed his arm against the throat of the declarant and put his other arm around his neck. It was said that they came before his ledger 3 . Initially, the declarant could not explain what had happened afterwards. 4 On 15 July 2021, the declarant stated that he was held in a stranglehold by the big boy in his home and that he was beaten. That's all he could remember. 5

The declarant gave the following description of the man who grabbed him: he was slightly tinted, possibly of Moroccan origin and his length reached his eyebrows. The declarant himself is 1.92 meters. The man spoke good Dutch. The man standing at the window had a stocky build and a stubble beard. The reporter could not give a description of the third man. All three men wore green jackets, one of which was brighter in color. 6

5.1 Bitcoin was taken in the robbery. 7 The declarant had two ledgers and two recovery seeds 8 with which access could be gained to his bitcoins. One of the ledgers was in a white bowl in the kitchen. 9 If the recovery seed had not been found, then according to the declarant it could only be that he had given the code of the ledger under duress. 10 The Ledger Live program on the declarant's computer is used to transfer bitcoins. To do this, the ledger must be connected to the computer and a pin code must be entered that the declarant knows by heart. According to the declarant, the code was knocked out of him during the robbery or the code was stored in a text file on his computer. 11

Two neighbors of the declarant were heard as witnesses. Witness [name 1] heard someone banging on his door at midnight on 24 June 2021. He found the reporter. His wrists and ankles were duct taped. His arms were tied behind his body and the duct tape stretched from the tips of his fingers to his wrists. The reporter had a cut on his head that was bleeding profusely and his left eye was swollen and closed. 12

Witness [name 2] lives in the apartment above that of the declarant. He was asked for help by witness [name 1]. He saw that the declarant had tape around his mouth and a lot of tape and a tie wrap around his wrists. His head was blue. Witness [name 2] heard people in the home of the declarant between 9:30 PM and 10:30 PM. This was striking, because the declarant hardly ever had visitors in the evening. 13

Officers who approached the report found the declarant with a bloodied face with multiple swellings. He was very confused and the injury seemed to be affecting his memory. 14

The declarant was examined in the hospital by a forensic doctor on 25 June 2021. He has been diagnosed with mild traumatic skull-brain injury and bruises and abrasions all over his body. In addition, he had blurred vision, his eyelids were significantly swollen and he had a wound above his eyebrow.

1. Bitcoin is the medium of exchange and store of value in a country.
2. The vast majority of people just save money since there is no more government-induced inflation. Prices of all goods are relatively stable except in natural disaster situations and supply chain fluctuations.
3. The financial investment industry has shrunk exponentially. There are still people who are investors and provide this expertise for a fee or commission.
4. It is extremely transparent where each Satoshi of your taxes go to. Public entitlement programs are very limited and completely funded as the money supply is almost 100% predictable now. Publicly funded pensions are almost unheard of. There are a lot more private companies providing what were once largely publicly funded services such as public safety.
5. Banks still exist but their business model is more about pooling investor funds and providing a Bitcoin custody service for the people who don't feel comfortable holding their own coins. Bitcoin custodial services are a big deal as personal home robberies are now fairly commonplace. Banks are not required to have a 1:1 reserve ratio, but customers understand that if a bank does not then they may lose their money if something happens to the bank. Banks are nowhere near ""too big to fail"" anymore.
6. People can choose to invest their Bitcoin into various projects to try to multiply their wealth and they understand that they can lose their money if the project fails, end of story.
7. There is a free market for interest rates. Loans are largely sourced from private lenders and/or banks, but there is no more central bank nor a national interest rate decided by a small group of people. 
8. There is still a stock market because companies still have the freedom to try to publicly fund their business ideas, but it's no longer the behemoth that it once was as money is hard money and isn't as easy to come by as it once was.

16907,1671476826,False,"I've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basics of economics regarding currency, what gives it value, etc. I posted this as a comment in another thread that didn't get much attention, so I thought I would post it again as its own post to help those who are new to Bitcoin or don't have much understanding of the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin as a currency.

First  you need to ask yourself why the Dollar has any value. Learn a bit  about the history of money. The first currencies were commodity money.  They derived their value from their intrinsic use. But they were  cumbersome to use. So we invented paper money that was backed by  commodities such as gold, which could be exchanged for it, and gave it  value. In 1971 the US Fed stopped allowing Dollars to be exchanged for  gold, making our money fiat money with no backing. Fiat means ""command"".  It is created out of nothing by an issuing authority.

Now  think about what the Federal Reserve has been doing, and the effects  their actions have had on the economy. They previously lowered interest  rates to 0%. Interest rates are the cost of obtaining money. Money that  has no cost to obtain has an unlimited supply and its value will trend toward zero as the supply is diluted. The money  supply has been increased by more than 40% over the last 2 years, and  much more than that over the previous century. You can view the Fed's  own data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)  . The value of the  Dollar over the long term is trending toward zero,  along with every other fiat currency. Look at this chart and see how  much value it has lost over time. [https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1](https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1)

Most  money is already digital. It's just a database in your bank's servers that has names associated with amounts. Less than 10% of the money  supply exists as cash. It would be impossible for everyone to convert  their electronic deposits into cash. Banks actually create even more money when they make loans.[Reserve requirements were suspended](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm) in the COVID era meaning banks could create unlimited amounts of loans with no reserves at all. And what happened? The value of the Dollar tanked, of course. As it will continue to do once they start the money printer up again, once they get past the threat of higher than normal inflation.

This is stuff you would learn in an intro Economics class. But it's very fundamental to understanding why any currency has value, or loses its  value. Money derives its value from being something that is: fungible,  durable, divisible, portable, and limited in supply. The more of these  properties it has, the better it is as money. It must serve as a unit of  account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. The better it is  at these things, the better it is as money.

Bitcoin  has all of these qualities, making it useful as money. It's much more  divisible than the Dollar, much  more portable, and more limited in  supply. Since 2013, the Bitcoin network has not had a major outage or hack despite being an extremely high value target. It is free and open source, with out a central authority. So far,  its value has only gone up over the long term despite its high  volatility in the short term.

Limited  supply is essential a currency's potential as a long term store of  value. Many countries have hyperinflated their currencies with  disastrous results. Right now around the world many countries are  experiencing extremely high amounts of inflation. Learn about what has  happened in Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Hungary, and many more  countries due to hyperinflation. It's a crisis around the world. Almost  all the world's countries use fiat currency now. Many people in these  countries face authoritarian governments, or do not have access to a  stable currency. Bitcoin has obvious usefulness to these people as well  as anyone else who wants an alternative to fiat money that will do  nothing but lose value over time.",The basic economics of why Bitcoin has value,0.8

So if a hacker wants to get access to a Bitcoin address this person must hack the SH-256 for the public key, but it also needs to hack another hash function (I don’t remember the name) for the private key? 

I am right? Wrong? How is the likeliness with the current technology to hack both hash? Thanks",Question about hacking a Bitcoin address.,0.54

- 21 lessons

- The Fiat Standard
- Orange Coin Good

I too believe like many others, that in order for us to reach adoption is to actually use it. I'm currently using [Microlancer.io](https://Microlancer.io) *(freelancer market place to earn sats)* , to find freelancers from anywhere around the world and paying them satoshi's to do simple tasks. 

**Which in my case is for them to just record a thirty second video of themselves (disguised or not) answering any of these questions:**

* Create at least a 30 second video of yourself explaining why you think Bitcoin is important to our evolution as humans?
* What can Bitcoin provide for people?
* What attracted you to buy Bitcoin?

I think every voice is just as equal and impactful as the next person, equal to Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, your neighbor, someone across the world, etc. It's interesting to me to hear anyone's unique  perspective about this technology that is revolutionizing the way we function with another human regardless of the biased borders we created. And pay them in sats for it.

Question 1 (Transaction Inputs):

Where EXACTLY do the inputs come from? I learnt they are UTXO's (Unspent Transaction Outputs) from previous transactions. Which transactions, and to whom? Does every payment that comes to me generate a new UTXO? So for example, if 3 people have recently sent me BTC (to a single address I own), do I have 3 separate UTXO's to spend (use as inputs for *my* next transaction)?

That was my reasoning, and it seemed to be making sense, until I came across info that said the inputs can come from different addresses. Huh? Okay... Looks like they have a point though, because when I check the block explorer for transactions, I actually see distinct ADDRESSES as inputs and outputs. It should mean that every address can rather only have one UTXO at a time, right? And multiple UTXO's should definitely come from different addresses. But if multiple addresses are used as inputs, shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender? Because only the sender should authorise a transaction.

Now if that's the case, how is that done? Because with the wallets I've used (Trust and Binance), I don't see an option to select multiple addresses I own and combine their value when I'm sending BTC. So... What's happening? Can multiple inputs only be achieved using low level coding or something? When I search for ""How to send Bitcoin from multiple addresses"" or similar, I don't find *anything* that answers my question. It's as if that's not possible. I'm just not getting it. For the outputs, I understand. But the inputs haven't really been explained to me.

Can someone who understands this from A to Z spell it out for me without leaving anything out? I'd be really grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2 (Block confirmations and reversibility):

Many sources say that transactions that have 6 or more confirmations can be considered ""irreversible"". Okay, logically, that should mean that with less than 6 confirmations, the transaction *can* be reversed.

Now, what I know about block confirmations is that it's the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain *after* the one that contains the transaction in question. So that means even with one or two confirmations, the block *is* actually on the public blockchain, right? So if the transaction can be reversed, how is that done? Will it be pulled down from the blockchain? (funny question). What would happen to the 1-5 blocks after it? Meanwhile if you search for ""Can bitcoin transactions be reversed?"", all the answers you get are ""No."" So what's really the point here?",I have 2 BIG questions about Bitcoin transactions.,0.85

**For B :** If my friend Tom wants to send me some BTC and I create a second wallet on my Ledger, can the state know that the second address created on Ledger is linked to my first?   


Do I have to use a VPN or something to ""hide"" the BTC that the can send me directly to avoid that it ends up with BTC ""traced"" by Binance and the State.

Then an army of bureaucrats sends the sats back and forth to each others' wallets over and over again, producing far more than 7 transactions per second.  And that's all those bureaucrats do all day - it's their job.  And they could then afford to attach super-uber-crazy high fees to each transaction, say $5(worth of sats) per transaction, essentially ""crowding out"" anyone who wants to use the Bitcoin network to send their own transactions.  

It would drive the fees sky high, through the roof.  Which would cause most ordinary people, to be turned off from using Bitcoin.  If they kept this up for a few years, it would stifle the network and no one would want to use it.  Because you'd have to compete with those high fees, which are artificially driven up by governmental action.  

It really seems to me, that this could be the MOST effective way for the government to attack Bitcoin.  With just a couple billion $ (which is a drop in the bucket for the US govt, hell Powell could crank that out in a keystroke), they could make EVERY fee for an entire year be $5 (more likely FAR higher).  

Seriously.  7 transactions/second = about 221 million/year.  So for a little over a billion $, they could make the fees be at least $5 on each transaction.  Making it prohibitively expensive to use the network for any small transactions.

17047,1671558989,False,"TLDR: Let's have a discussion regarding the trend in price **volatility** (not price) for BTC and ware its heading. I would like to see some good analysis on this.

BTC has been the best performing asset in modern history but this has come with volatility like no other.

This volatility, while it lasts, is very much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold over the long term, even if they don't ""time the market"" particularly well (but better if they do!).

That said it's my understanding that volatility is (generally) decreasing year by year. While this is generally regarded as a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of BTC it also means that the ""oportunity"" presented by said volatility will lesson over time.

We see a lot of price projections (during the bull runs at least) but I don't see many volatility projections. 

Yesterday I was playing around with the simple annual percentage growths on chart and adding a trend line.

I simply observed that, yes, volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected **rate** of annual growth would also likley decrease going forward.

This doesn't mean that BTC isn't still an amazing investment oportunity in addition to all its other societal benifits - monetary freedom, store of value, etc.

But it does mean our growth expectations shouldn't be **AS** high as we observed in the last three halving cycles. 

I say ""expectations"" because there are always external factors (disasters, wars, new tech) that can affect short term price in iether direction.

I guess what  saying is, it would be interesting to see more (competent) analysis regarding the volatility trend and ware its heading.",Discussion: Projecting the reduction of price volatility,1.0

For the rare gems here who do use it according to Satoshi's vision, what security measures do you take? 

My first thought is about having completely separate HODL stack and SPEND stack. Since transactions are transparent and traceable, it would make sense to keep your savings separate from the coins you spend as to not become a target. For the most paranoid of us, even using different exchanges for each usecase could be, imho, a good idea. This lets you spend your sats safely, and allows you to HODL or sell when necessary, without exposing yourself.

This is probably super basic, so what other security measures do you use, or would you suggest?

17062,1671560129,False,"A big part of Bitcoin participation is awareness. As a protocol participant, as a node runner ([PLEASE LEARN HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN NODE](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)), in order to express your sovereignty and secure your Bitcoin activity you need to be aware of what's going on in the ecosystem.

One of the best ways to keep informed about Bitcoin proposals is the [BIP list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). Learning how to read and interpret these documents is critical to understanding how Bitcoin works. You don't need to know everything, the abstracts are very readable without foreknowledge. Consider them extensions of the whitepaper that provide actual specification. Keep in mind all BIPs aren't good. You decide what's good. Not all BIPs are implemented, in fact most are rejected. Learning how and why is also instructive. 

Excellent sources of information are the dev mailing lists and repos themselves. There's the [Bitcoin protocol development mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/), there is the [Core Bitcoin node dev list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/), there is the [lightning dev list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/), and there are a few others as well for various implementations. There is also the [Core repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) itself. These are great sources of primary discussion between devs. I'd ask you consider reading and understanding, these are high signal to noise ratio spaces and not social media. The content appropriate there is not the same as the content appropriate here. Please keep contributions substantive.

Every Wednesday there is a new [Optech Newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/) which attempts to summarize developer discussions on the mailing list. This is an excellent resource for those without the time or attention to parse the full mailing list.

Also on Wednesdays are the community [Bitcoin PR review clubs](https://bitcoincore.reviews/). These are an *excellent* way to become versed in how Bitcoin core development works and get involved in either developing yourself, or grow your comprehension of what is going on in Bitcoin repositories.

If you aren't running a node, if you aren't ready to dive this deep, you can still start your dive at your own pace and make your way down using [lists of community curated resources.](https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html) There is [one for lightning too.](https://lopp.net/lightning.html)

There is no rush. There is no time limit. There is no end to learning.

17074,1671564294,False,"Bitcoin maxis love the idea of Bitcoin becoming a widely used as a “deflationary currency”, and it is often compared to gold as a store of value. Let’s look at the history of the gold standard as a comparison - specifically the departure from the gold standard. 

Leading up to and after WWII, the gold standard was swapped for the Bretton Woods System until it was erased by Nixon in the early 70’s. Executive order 6102, enacted under FDR, required all Americans to submit their gold to the Federal Reserve Bank. After the war, the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement signified a change in the global system, in which all countries in the agreement were required to “guarantee convertibility of their currencies into U.S Dollars… with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at $35 per troy oz” (wikipedia). This means all countries exchange for U.S dollars backed by redeemable gold, but that gold is only redeemable by banks and governments, not your average citizen. 

Now my question is highly theortecial: what if the U.S. enacted a similar order for Bitcoin in the wake of a collapsing global market, and it was made illegal for citizens to hold bitcoin. The government pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis. There would be a branch of the federal reserve devoted to mining, rogue mining operations would be highly illegal, and other countries would compete for maximum mining outputs. This would have dramatic effects on the development of the cryptocurrency industry, and on the world. There would be many negatives and positives. What do you think?

17081,1671567914,False,"Hi Bitcoiners!

I am very interested in running a full node and I need quite a bit of help. I'm not a super tech heavy person, but I understand some of the nuances.

So here is the issue I have. I began downloading the timechain, and got to about 15%. At this point the Core client said it would be about 2 weeks before the whole chain would be downloaded. FYI, I plugged in my ethernet chord and this did not help.

My computer specs:

* 2020 Mac Mini
* 8 GB RAM
* 256 GB Storage

I decided to save the chain to my external hard drive that has 1 TB of storage. It had no problem saving it there until the issue around 15% (I read that this can cause the chain to be stored much more slowly, plus the IBD can go slower when processing power is being used up by other computer functions).

I think I might have a solution. I have two monitors hooked up to my Mac mini 2020. I have concluded that it might be best to buy a 2011 Mac mini (because it has a hard drive that I can remove and replace to something larger, ideally 1 TB of storage). I can then hook my monitor up to the 2011 mac mini, download Core and the timechain, and then hook my monitor back to my original 2020 mac, and allow the 2011 mac to just run as a full node; this would be great to have a UI whenever I want to look at the node and it would have the full 8 GB of ram and TB of storage from the 2011 mac.

I'm trying my best to keep my 2020 mac clean from large downloads because it's my work and personal computer and given my current storage situation I would only be able to download a third of the chain before I am at capacity.

* What do you see as a problem?
* What do you think would be a better solution? (I've read that raspberry PIs are good, but I don't know how to use it and this 2011 Mac is roughly only 50$ so not too bad for what I want to use it as).
* Is it better to just download the timechain to my external hard drive on my current mac and wait the two weeks before it's fully downloaded?
* Advice?

1. Hurts relationships. Jealousy-humans are envious. It will hurt friendships if you become the rich person if everyone else is average/poor. 
2. Hurts income -the thing you are using to acquire more btc. Do not, for the love of all that is holy, tell your boss, even if said boss owns btc, that you own a lot. If you own 10 btc, tell him you own 2.  If bitcoin goes up a lot, he will say ""well Joe doesn't need a raise"".

3. Gives you a false sense of wealth. You start seeing your ledger balance, you stop stacking. You start spending. I should have had 4 rental properties-I did-but I had to give them up, and now I have 2. I decided to blow money on some stupid ass shit and could have kept at least one instead of paying for dinner for a bunch of fake ass freeloaders.

I believe there is no excuse for anyone in the first world who has a family they can live with to get to 5 coins. 
4. Safety-You are not helping yourself by letting people think you have a valuable asset UNLESS you live in an extremely safe area. Look at la, look at nyc. People getting robbed on the streets. You might be an honest person; many people will steal, hurt, rob, for $10. Imagine what they are willing to do for hundreds of thousands or millions.
5. Keeps you from the big goal. Money is supposed to be spent. For many, money can be: I can retire at 50 instead of 60. For others it can be I can take a job I want versus the job that pays now. It could be a gt3...and for a few, it will be the ability to live life on your own terms. I beg of you: that dumb watch, that fast car, the lavish gifts-they mean NOTHING. Reach for the big goal.
6. Makes you a gambler. For many, I believe we HAVE not seen the real gambling begin in housing, crypto, or the stock market.

17163,1671622632,False,"An excerpt from my new Substack newsletter. You can find the whole episode here: https://open.substack.com/pub/carlbmenger/p/what-the-heck-is-inflation?r=cvmtq&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post

In this episode, we discuss inflation, well more specific the impact of monetary expansion on the general price level because there is a lot of confusion on this subject. I try to create clarity in this episode. So let’s dive in.

Unfortunately, a lot of terms are mixed up in the current debate about rising prices and inflation. This is bad, because linguistic desensitisation prevents us from recognising cause and effect and subsequently makes it difficult to solve the causal problem.

Instead, inadequate measures such as price controls and nationalization are often called for to combat the wave of price increases, while inflation continues to be stoked in the background. In particular, it is crucial to distinguish between inflation and price increases, which are unfortunately considered synonymous in today's discussion.

Inflation

“Inflation (Latin: „īn-flāre“; inflate, swell) is an increase in the quantity of money and credit. Full stop.”

First and foremost: The general term inflation is NOT defined as rising prices, like the media and central banks propagate. Moreover, for them, inflation is primary the rising prices of things people buy day by day, which they call Consumer Price ‘Inflation’ (CPI). But, as we will see, inflation is and has always been the expansion of the money supply, nothing more than the voluntary act of central banks to increase the amount of money in an economy.

Common jargon confuses the effect for the cause. Expanding the money quantity is inflation, the rising price level (commonly called ‘price inflation’), is in reality a devaluation of the currency and the effect of monetary expansion over a longer period of time. Thus, the bottom line is:

“Inflation is a political engineered increase in the money supply.”

Rising prices therefore do not equal inflation, although inflation in the classical sense can have a major impact on “prices”, as we will see.
But first, it is very important to distinguish between increasing prices of some things, which is usually referred to as Consumer Price ‘Inflation’ (CPI), and the increase of the general price level of all things as an aggregate.

Consumer Price ‘Inflation’

A widely used price index is the CPI, an index which tries to reflect changes in the prices of goods and services typically purchased by consumers. When the media reports on the rate of inflation, it usually cites a figure calculated using the CPI. This flawed concept aggregates fundamentally different goods and services, adding them up and then calculating an ""average price"" from it.

On the one hand, this measure does not take into account changes in the quality of goods and services. On the other hand, the government can have a great influence on the basket of goods and services used for the calculation by determining which products and services are inside the basket. In this process, higher quality products are regularly exchanged for lower quality products, thus manipulating the CPI rate significantly over time.

The General Price Level

For this reason, we “Austrians” look at prices as an aggregate which is mathematically determined by the total amount of money that is available for spending in a given period of time (Money Quantity x Money Velocity), in relation to the total supply of all real values which are available for purchase with money in that period of time. The law of determining an aggregate price level is the following:

Price level =
(Money Quantity x Money Velocity) : (Supply of all real Goods)

This means, that the aggregate price level moves in direct proportion to the quantity and the velocity (the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period) of money. It moves in inverse proportion to the aggregate supply of all real values.

If the money supply increases by let’s say 30% (2020–2022), while the supply of values and velocity of money remain constant, the general price level tents to rise in the direction of +30%. Of course, this is a strong simplification, because either velocity could go down or the supply of all real values could go up, and thus having a dampening or reinforcing effect on the general price level.

However, this does not change the fact that the direction of the general price level is determined by the underlying money supply. The original increase of the money supply, often temporarily masked by a reduction of money velocity, was what set the equilibrium level of prices higher than their actual level and thus created the inflationary bias. The difference between the actual price level and the higher equilibrium price level is the unrealized depreciation of a currency, and the living process of working upward from the lower to the higher is inflation.

The direction of the equilibrium level and the breadth of the gap indicates which way prices must move and how far at a maximum, but not necessarily when or how fast. Therefore, it is the underlying money demand available which dictates to buyers and sellers the way their prices must go and where they must arrive, leaving it to them to decide when and at what speed they will accompany one another to that point. 

Nonetheless, the root of the price increase is and remains the original monetary expansion: You can’t just increase the money supply many times over and assume that there would be no consequences. Why should money not be subject to the laws of supply and demand? An increasing supply with simultaneously unchanged or falling demand leads to falling purchasing power. Therefore, one thing is clear to representatives of the Austrian School of Economics:

“The more monetary units in circulation, 
the lower their quality is perceived to be.”

Let’s summarize it:
First, the money supply increases, money velocity falls behind, and prices remain steady. Later, money velocity recovers, prices begin to rise, and equilibrium eventually returns to the level fixed by the original money supply expansion. Therefore, the money expansion is the cause, rising prices the effect and not vice versa.

That's it for now. Thanks for reading this episode. Feedback is always highly appreciated.

The problem is people with significant amounts of capital make it ultra competitive for an everyday household miner to justify the costs and means.

I wish a company would develop a new technology that would be 2-3x efficient and half the wattage, but the key component would be that it would only sell the 2 miners per household as a limit such that corporations and large players couldn't suck up all the hash rate.

Then it would make sense for millions of people to have miners and it would distribute the mining across a lot more people who could be in mining pools anyways, but then it would decentralize mining further.

I hope someday some a company comes in and does something like this. It would be cool to have miners in all households just like an everyday modem.

17308,1671650964,False," TLDR: when asked about Bitcoin's value, I try to derive it from the four main uses that I see (store of value, means of payment, unit of account, efficiency of energy grids). I developed a conservative approach to it, in order to evaluate the capture of those current established markets, so that I would personally feel confortable assigning Bitcoin a value of $430k per coin in today's dollars. This helps me frame conversations and remove emotions from people focusing on short-term price action

First of all: This is not a number-go-up post. This is the way I think about explaining Bitcoin to my friends and relatives.

I am trying to create a framework for evaluating Bitcoin's value (both the network and the asset). The way I see it, many out there have just taken a segmented approach, based on one of the uses that Bitcion has.

When asked the question ""what is Bitcoin"", or ""what value does Bitcoin provide"", I oftentimes say ""it depends"", because this value can be derived from the different uses that Bitcoin has. Not everyone has to use Bitcoin in the same way, after all.

Of course, this is not about making an in-depth analysis. Rather, I'm confortable with having an estimation of the order of magnitude, and I took some assumptions I would consider rather conservative. Of course, everything here is measured in today's dollars (meaning, not accounted for further future debasement).

For me:

1. **Bitcoin is a store of value**  
   
The constant chase for yield, both at an intitutional and at an individual level, is a by-product of fiat money. People would not have the need to put whatever they could save into the S&amp;P 500, in order to try to maintain their purchasing power over time.  
   
50 years ago, one salary would still be enough to provide for a whole family, and the cost of living related to the income level was lower. The charts in [WTF Happened In 1971?](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) are not just coincicence.  
   
Bitcoin, indeed, solves this.  
   
I focus here on the three main assets currently being used (among others) as stores of value: the stock market, the bond market and the real estate market.  
   
The stock market: Statista gives an [estimate](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1vPed9Ir8AhVHS_EDHYc6DPAQFnoECAkQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F274490%2Fglobal-value-of-share-holdings-since-2000%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAs%2520of%2520June%25202022%252C%2520the%2Cas%2520105.07%2520trillion%2520U.S.%2520dollars.&amp;usg=AOvVaw28MbLv02e35v_jEeKqeuhL) of around $105T as of June 2022  
The bond market: around $31T by the end of 2021, taking the data of the Bank for International Settlements - I've taken only the bonds of central governments: [BIS statistics](https://www.bis.org/statistics/c2.pdf)  
   
The real estate market: currently valued in about $11.5 trillion at the end of 2021 (one source being e.g. [this MSCI report](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8f62c2a3-8374-cbf9-a7d2-a8c2c5e63e62)).  
   
When both individuals and institutions come to realize that, with Bitcoin, they won't need to take any risks with any investments in external companies, Governments, or particular locations in order to maintain their purchasing power over time, I see Bitcoin taking over up to 20% of these markets. Hence, a piece of those markets valued at $29.5T  
 
2. **Bitcoin is a means of payment**  
   
The base layer, with final settlement without trusted third party, is not akin but better than the current Swift system and equivalents. As Swift is a cooperative owned by financial institutions worldwide, I don't have yet a way to value it. I tried to look into Swift's reports, but they report their figures in number of ""messages"" across banks, and not in monetary value transferred. If the data vas available, I would have guessed the value as a small percentage -maybe 0.5%- of all transacted volume.  
   
Lightning and other Layer two implementations are not akin, but better than the current payment providers. According to [this report](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/payment-processing-solutions-market-751866.html), current 2022 market valuation of these combined payment processors is $91B.  
   
I see Bitcoin taking long term a 20% of the whole ""means of payment"" market. The problem is, I cannot estimate a value for it yet.  
 
3. **Bitcoin is a unit of account**  
   
Currently, we use fiat money to denominate the value of things. The total amount of fiat can be then split among the different assets that have value. The problem with the current system is that fiat is being constantly debased, so we see prices going up, and we take this as a proxy for growth, while it's actually the opposite: a proxy for theft through wealth redistribution.  
   
Bitcoin, also, fixes this.  
   
So I try to measure fiat money supply, and my best estimation here so far is to estimate the global broad money (M3).  
   
The World Bank has [two](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FM.LBL.BMNY.GD.ZS) different [charts](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) estimating global broad money as a % of GDP, and global GDP. Latest figures are of 2020 for the first one of them, so those are the values I take: $84.91T of global GDP, and 143.5% M3/GDP: this results in a total $121.85T of broad money globally.  
   
If a 10% of all things are denominated in the future in Bitcoin, potentially up to $12.2T value of things can be potentially sold for Bitcoin.  
 
4. **Bitcoin makes the existing energy production more efficient**  
   
When miners look for a profitable way to run their operations, three possitive side-effects can happen:  
   
(1) they use already installed energy that previously had no demand, allowing for a more efficient use of the network, hence bringing average cost per unit of energy down  
   
(2) they subsidize the generation of new energy, lowering the contribution share to already existing market participants  
   
(3) they can generate electricity in a profitable way from excess production and/or energy sub-products (e.g. flaring)  
   
This makes the overall energy industry more efficient. If Bitcoin would contribute to generate and capture a 5% additional efficiency in the global energy market, taking as an estimation a global energy consumption of 580.5M Terajoules in 2018 ([source](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/climate-change/energy/global-energy-consumption)), an average global price per kWh of $0.1 (conservative estimation based on this [source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/electricity_prices/)), and being one Terajoule 277,778 kWh, this 5% efficiency gain would be valued at $0.81T  
 

I don't see the previous four uses of Bitcoin as mutually exclusive. Hence the potential value that I see it could get is the sum of the three of them that I can have an estimate for (missing the means of payment use).

This mean that up to around $42.5T could flow into Bitcoin. Taking this value as the total potential, I assign a conservative 10% chance of that happening, which would result in an expected inflow of $4.25T.

Now, my last estimation is to try to assess which available supply does this $4.25T meet. Based on the [hodl waves](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiFsO3N44r8AhVxX_EDHa50D1oQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookintobitcoin.com%2Fcharts%2Fhodl-waves%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DHODL%2520Waves%2520is%2520a%2520Bitcoin%2Clike%2520patterns%2520on%2520the%2520chart.&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LmTNhiAz6bW5jK0pH1IT-), I estimate the following:

* \&gt;10y: 5% probability of being available for sell. Currently 13.52% of total supply
* 7&lt;y&lt;10: 10% probability of being available for sell. Currently 6.11% of total supply
* 5&lt;y&lt;7:15% probability of being available for sell. Currently 7.44% of total supply
* 3&lt;y&lt;5: 20% probability of being available for sell. Currently 11.37% of total supply
* 2&lt;y&lt;3: 40% probability of being available for sell. Currently 7.24% of total supply
* 1&lt;y&lt;2: 60% probability of being available for sell. Currently 20.25% of total supply
* y&lt;1: 80% probability of being available for sell. Currently the rest (34.07%) of total supply

Leaving total supply as 21M (and not the current one, since this inflow of capital eventually happens in the future), then this capital meets a total of 9.865.590 bitcoins. Hence, this could value each one of those coins at around $430.000, bringing total Bitcoin's market cap to $9.05T.","This is my mental framework to evaluate Bitcoin's value, for making decisions but specially for talking to others about Bitcoin",0.81

17491,1671707886,False," So I see here [https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/ColdWasabi.html](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/ColdWasabi.html) that it is easy to use Wasabi with a hardware wallet. Once the hardware wallet has been connected to Wasabi, you can :  
\- Generate a receiving address for a hot Wasabi wallet. When the sats are received, Wasabi will start a Coinjoin process in the background, until the privacy reachs 100%  
\- Once it is done, you can transfer the sats to one of the address of the hardware wallet

But, I'm wondering : if you transfer 100% of the sats, wouldn't it tell anyone looking at the blockchain that you are the same person at the one who did the CoinJoin in the first place ?

So :

What is it? A protocol for sharing short messages that uses key pairing similar to bitcoin.  Built by bitcoin developers - bitcoin lightning payments are native across the system and are the incentive structure to the various components.

Users generate a key pair, public key is essentially your username, private key your password. When a user wants to do something (post, like, follow, share, etc) they publish a short message signed by their key to as many relays as they want (can also host their own relay).

Users can use a client (see link at top for list of clients and how they feel) to specify relays they would like to query events from - the client will restore their followers, messages, etc from the relays.  Some clients behave like telegram, some like twitter, some like reddit. 

If a client does something you don't like (ads, censorship (they may not render some posts) etc.) Then you move to a new client and use your keys there. all of your data, history, and identity are preserved.

Lightning integrations are already super easy, as the project moves towards beta - likes with be streaming sats to posts, relays may monetize by data mining their users (be free) or you can use a relay that accepts sats for storage.

All the good parts of the web3 promise came.. and they came on bitcoin.

One edit: this is alpha version, clients are still figuring things out, do not use sensitive keys in any of these applications. Use a fresh key and know that it could be leaked. The lightning extension alby, or nos2x (nostr specific extension) can be used for better key security with most clients.","Decentralized social media is here, and it's built on bitcoin.",0.73

I just listened to a Saylor monologue. He's far ahead of the crowd, he can see a possible future. The question is? How bad do things have to get for it to change.  


Unfortunately, and fortunately, I think the answer is much longer than we expect (or at least I do).

We have been told a tale that we ""can't pass the debt on to our children"" but we continue to stand on them. How bad does it have to get:

Look at the dating scene: if you are over 30, attractive, interesting, and decently off...guess what, you don't exist. Or the real answer: someone has snatched you up.

Look at the health scene: It is terrifying.

Look at the financial scene: the median American is worth for 45-54 is 168,600. This means 50% of the people in the US, including their 401k, their home equity, has a net worth under $168,600. But do people care? No. I'm a landlord and I have tenants who make 80-150k, are single, are in their 30s, and who have NO money. I thought they would stop drinking/coke. I was wrong.

So why is this a good and bad thing? Well it means that bitcoin is probably far off from being recognized. To quote a moron, we aren't even thinking about thinking about buying bitcoin.

But terrifyingly, many people still think owning BTC is optional.

I have friends who say they're afraid of buying BTC or think it's some fancy toy or something complicated and for computer geeks only.

How can one possibly think that, given the omnipresent educational campaigns and promotion of BTC by big public figures like Michael Saylor, Lyn Alden, Jeff Booth etc.?

That's like saying ""I don't need food, food is for geeks, I don't mind dying of hunger soon. Learning how to avoid premature death by buying food is not worth my time.""

Sure there is a learning curve, but if learning how to use the money of the future is not worth investing in, what is? It's not like the ability to buy bread with fiat shitcoins is going to last forever.

This is a serious concern of mine. I don't even know how to approach it, they represent a different level of consciousness.

They embrace concepts of private &amp; mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represent ""post-blockchain"", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of ""tokens"".  
Dr. Maxim Orlovsky wrote a proposal on a new RGB node API which accounts for schema-independent interfaces - and node extensibility to support new interfaces without compillation.

Basically this will render smart contract and wallet programmers’ developer cycle will become fully independent from RGB Node release cycle.

If you're giving out Bitcoin this holidays consider making sure that's something the recipient would be comfortable with. You might consider playing with some testnet coins and wallets with them before Christmas, or as you're teaching them how to handle their coins. Many wallets such as https://blockstream.com/green/ and https://electrum.org/ have testnet features where you can enable experimentations without losses. You can get testnet coins with a google on [mainnet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/) or [lightning](https://htlc.me/). You can send testnet coins to services like [yalls](https://testnet.yalls.org/) if you're on lightning. You can also send to exchanges to learn how to fake-trade like [Bitmex](https://testnet.bitmex.com/) on mainnet.

17810,1671835238,False,"The link I have shared as part of this post really made me stop and think today. It's an estimate of listening and non-listening bitcoin node.

If you consider yourself a Bitcoiner, this should worry you. What you see is a slow decay of a statistic that should be growing year on year. Especially now, when people are moving to self custody, as the shitcoins die, and when people are seeing the true value of Bitcoin as a tool of freedom.

The misconception about running a node is that you are supporting the network. But it's not really about that. Running a node is YOU exerting control. It's YOU saying ""these are my rules, THIS is what I want Bitcoin to be"". And if many users engage this selfish act, Bitcoin becomes stronger! That's the magic right there.

Look at the blocksize wars, at the big blocker corporate interests signalling for segwit2x, look at the RBF nonsense as people who don't understand the risks and function of Bitcoin try to dictate how the network should work. Node runners are the main line of defense against these actors. YOU can be there in the phalanx, in fact you SHOULD be there, with a spear in hand ready to strike at that which you must fight. A shield locked with those you would share concensus with.

If you do not run a Bitcoin node you are allowing the essence of bitcoin to rot through inaction. For your sake, for the sake of your bitcoin and, critically, for the sake of Bitcoin's soul. Run a node.

You don't need a raspberry pi, you don't need an old computer, you don't need to run Linux or make a sever or any of that shit. What you need is to download bitcoin core from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/) for your OS, verify it, and install it. Congratulations. You now operate a node. If you can't spare the disk space?Prune it. Can't dedicate the bandwidth? Don't propagate blocks. Don't want people to know you use bitcoin? Enable tor. The possible configurations are huge and there are [tools to help you configure it as well](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/). Wallets like sparrow will easily connect to your node too, so you can effortlessly have privacy in your transactions too.

Aren't sure what you are doing? Don't worry, ask for help here, go to the daily thread, go to the /r/bitcoin discord. Ask. Ask. Ask. People will help you. And then, one day, pay it forward. I have included some helpful links to get you going. But if you are new to this whole thing and have questions then please ask away.

[How to run a node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#secure-your-wallet)

[How to run a pruned node if you cant spare disk space.](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/behind-btc/nodes/pruned-node/)

Remember, there may come another blocksize war, it may happen sooner than you think. Be prepared to make yourself self-sovereign or face the consequences of inaction.

17880,1671881206,False,"This is a common argument made by nocoiners. Bitcoin is intrinsically worthless therefore it's value should be zero and therefore it will go to zero.

But does that even make sense and what does that even mean?

First thing is that intrinsic value has different meanings it's more like a philosophical concept not something where we can even clearly define what we are talking about.

In all definitions used intrinsic value is also something that has  a subjective element and is based on personal perceptions and judgement.

Let's look at some of the definitions used:

the first is the philosophical definition

&gt;If something has intrinsic value or intrinsic interest, it is valuable or interesting because of its basic nature or character, and not because of its connection with other things.

[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/intrinsic-value](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/intrinsic-value)

the second is the definition used in a financial context

&gt;the real value of a company, asset, etc., which may not be the price it could be sold for now:

[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/intrinsic-value](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/intrinsic-value)

&gt;What Is Intrinsic Value? Intrinsic value is a measure of what an asset is worth. This measure is arrived at by means of an objective calculation or complex financial model. Intrinsic value is different from the current market price of an asset.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp#:\~:text=Investopedia%20%2F%20Theresa%20Chiechi-,What%20Is%20Intrinsic%20Value%3F,market%20price%20of%20an%20asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp#:~:text=Investopedia%20%2F%20Theresa%20Chiechi-,What%20Is%20Intrinsic%20Value%3F,market%20price%20of%20an%20asset)

I would argue that we stick to the definition in a financial context.

As we can see even in finance we find different definitions.

Intrinsic values are most commonly used in the context of stock investing. The intrinsic value of  a stock is either the value of future cash flows or the value of the assets of the company or  a combination of both.

Even with stocks it's rare that people agree on what the intrinsic value is since future earnings are difficult to estimate and the value of assets is often hard to determine. Some stocks don't have earnings or assets but they trade based on hopes that they may generate earnings in the future (biotech or pharma stocks)

Thus estimating an intrinsic value is often about guessing what something is worth.

Does everything in finance have an intrinsic value? No in fact many in finance argue that gold doesn't have an intrinsic value since it trades at  a large premium to it's industrial demand which is only 10% of  the market. Some argue that gold has value for psychological reasons because it's shiny.

&gt;Some people argue that gold has no intrinsic value, that it is a barbaric relic which no longer holds the monetary qualities of the past

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071114/why-gold-has-always-had-value.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071114/why-gold-has-always-had-value.asp)

Fiat currency is intrinsically worthless. Since Bitcoin is closest to money and gold and was never intended to be something else it's misleading or dishonest to talk about the intrinsic value of Bitcoin since neither gold nor money is traded based on it's intrinsic value.

Bitcoin could be the only remaining currency in the world and it's intrinsic value would still be zero.

So claiming that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value does not give us any information at all and it means little in the context that we are dealing with.

So why do people talk about intrinsic values?

I think in some cases it's people from traditional finance who know only how to value stocks and use a valuation model for stocks for something they don't understand. Using an inappropriate model tells them the value is zero. In that case it's a lack of critical thinking and unwillingness to learn something new.

In other cases it's more like a personal belief that Bitcoin is worthless. Of course those people don't live in countries with weak currencies and unstable financial systems. Just calling Bitcoin worthless sounds like an opinion not an argument so they throw in fancy financial terminology to make themselves sound more authoritative and convincing. It means Bitcoin is worthless and I understand that because I am financially literate (and you are not)",The fallacy of Bitcoin not having any intrinsic value,0.64

Having Bitcoin in self-custody is kind of like having cash stashed in your house, or more appropriately having gold coins hidden in a vault buried in a secret location that only you know about. The difference with Bitcoins in self-custody is that it is even more secure than physical cash or gold.

Scammers, fraudsters and enemies of Bitcoin are constantly trying to convince you that taking custody of your Bitcoin is too hard.

**This is a lie. Do NOT believe them.**

## Bitcoin self-custody: it’s easier than you think!

Custodial services can restrict access to your money, freeze or seize your funds, they keep your transaction data, they are targets for hackers, and honey pots for hostile government agencies. Using custodial services defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin.

Your Bitcoin journey begins with downloading a mobile or desktop application called a Bitcoin wallet. **It only takes a few minutes, it’s free, it’s fun, it’s secure and it’s easy.**

Your Bitcoin wallet will be your gateway to the Bitcoin network. It will allow you to send &amp; receive funds, and monitor your transactions &amp; account balances. You do not need permission from anyone to send or receive payments. 

They can be used both for secure long-term savings or convenient day-to-day transactions.

2017-2021: 3.5X from top to top and 20X from bottom to top (roughly)

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fucking bullish on this space it's insane. I can feel it throughout my body. Remember that feeling waking up and your portfolio was 10, 20, or 30k larger everyday? I've been here since 12' and am cultivating an inverse FOMO - FUD relationship. As we get into the heart of the bear, build a mindset of FOMO. From a historical perspective the FIAT regime has really only existed in it's current form since the 1970's. We're looking at a roughly 50 year cycle and collapse within probably 70 years. Around 2040, due to technological innovations the world will not look, feel, or exist in the current form. The sociological paradigm shift will be so utterly different from today that each subsequent generation is going to rug the next. Conservatism paradigms that once applied between between 75 year old's and teenagers are gong to be felt between a generational 10 year gap. Not 70 years. What am I trying to say you ask?

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, rugging the current financial system really isn't that big of a deal. The only constant is change and a global power shift from one system, isn't really that uncommon, unusual, or difficult. It's happening right now with 99 percent of the world sitting on the sidelines naysaying. Except everyday the the naysayer crowd is bleeding numbers. Andreas Antonopoulos says you don't change the current system from within, you make the old system obsolete. This is literally happening day by day, block by block.

&amp;#x200B;

Get bullish, go long, HODL. You only need 8 years in this space to retire with a little research, common sense and understanding private key cryptography. 8 years due to the deflationary effect of technology on prices. You can be the beneficiary of this just by holding BTC. Continue to build your working knowledge of the space, self custody in safe ways, and go hyper bull in the depths of the bear. You will be rewarded handsomely in 24' 25' and 26'. As we enter the deepest darkest days know that once this cycle collapses and a new one is born you will absolutely be vindicated. Welcome to the show.

But let's be real: the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin isn't just a passing fad. It's a sign of the times, and a testament to the bright future that lies ahead for this revolutionary digital currency.

You see, Bitcoin is more than just a means of exchange. It's a symbol of the changing financial landscape, a beacon of hope for a more decentralized and equitable world. And as more and more people catch on to the benefits of Bitcoin, it's only natural that the price will continue to rise.

But it's not just about the price. Bitcoin is also a powerful tool for financial freedom, allowing individuals to take control of their own wealth and transact without the interference of banks or governments. And as the global economy becomes increasingly unstable, it's clear that Bitcoin is the safe haven that people are turning to.

I have managed to stay in the targeted 150%-200% of locked up BTC forwarded per day. I am trying my best to push these numbers even higher, but for now about 200% seems to be the limit.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see a sharp drop in payment size at the end of November. This was caused by the adoption of zero-base fee. Shortly after this I have changed my min\_htlc settings to block free leaching. This leaded to the stabilization in December

My average ppm taken for forwarding payments has been steadily rising in December. This is not because I’ve changed my fee schedule, but rather because more and more traffic can flow to heavy sinks, as my rebalancing is getting better.

As I am not using and standard plugins, I must write my own tools.It took me till the start of October to get my Rebalancer to a point where it uses less fees than it earns. Since then, I have made steady progress towards better rebalancing. But there are the occasional bugs in my code (see the negative spike in December) that ruin my days

Each year the Big Boys n Girls (Amazon, Google, Apple, Costco etc) need to dock a percentage of their cash reserves into prospective investments that might help the company move more fluidly into the Future. Sometimes this is an acquisitions of smaller companies or purchasing the rights of product names to add to their brand etc. We've seen this with Google's $50 million purchase of Android (2005) or Pfizer's $90 Billion purchase of Warner Lambert (2000).

BTC is on everyone's radar. Be assured that every large company has a Crypto Dept incorporated into their Research and Development Department. If I was on that team I would be ORANGE PILLING the fuck out of BTC to my CFO.

Rest assure that this is taking place and the New Year will start to see BTC adoption go parabolic.

2. Connect the power and start the machine.

(Within several minutes of starting up, there will be a warm-up stage of the miner, and the miner will start running with a large noise after a while).

When the miner is connected to the router, you can find it by searching the new network address added from the router background.

### Set up your ASIC miner

If you are on the same LAN with only one miner, then you could type your IP address directly into your browser and display the login page, the default username: root, and the default password: root.

Then you need to configure your machines in the miner background, enter into the “my configuration” page and fill in the mining pool address and your worker name. Now your setup has been completed, and you can check your miner account in the miner pool within several minutes.",How To Set Up an ASIC Miner from Beginning?,0.44

18319,1672148003,False,"Good morning, I've been in Bitcoin for less than two years so I just don't know enough to discuss some topics but I wanted to make a statement about how privacy is KEY to Bitcoin success.

Bitcoin is meant to be a form of electronic cash sent between peers, its main goal is to grant people a way of exiting the FIAT system (at least partially) and in order to do so Bitcoin needs to be antifragile, but bitcoiners need to be like that too cause there is no Bitcoin without bitcoiners.

You can make sure nobody is taking your BTC away by taking your coins into self-custody. And that's true but MANY people who have been on the space for much longer than me, assure that having your keys its already enough. I strongly disagree with that, you need PRIVACY to be antifragile, if your coins are KYCd you are an easy target for anybody with enough knowledge to trace you (government included).

Many think nobody is going to take the time to trace you in that way, well I think they will as soon as you do something they find disturbing enough (and Bitcoin success is something they will find so very disturbing)

I can't express properly how important a good privacy is for a bitcoiner and I am so worried that the main voices in the space usually just don't care about it; cause ""you only need privacy if you are doing something wrong"".

First of all that's a lie and secondly well who says what's wrong.

The only way they won't go against you at some point is if they don't know who to go against.",Privacy in Bitcoin is more important that you think,0.87

In June  2021, when the cryptocurrency markets were soaring, the developers of  the Arte condominium in Miami’s Surfside neighborhood announced that a  buyer had purchased a penthouse there for $22.5 million in  cryptocurrency. The deal, one of the most expensive ever done using  digital coins, was heralded as evidence that cryptocurrency would  eventually become commonplace in the real-estate world.

Now, with the [crypto markets crashing back to earth](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-onetime-fans-are-calling-it-quits-after-ftx-collapse-11671327554?page=1&amp;mod=article_inline) after the[ implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-your-guide-to-the-crypto-crash-11669375609?mod=article_inline),  that same buyer has resold at a loss for $18 million. The deal closed  for cash this time, said Danny Hertzberg of Coldwell Banker Realty, one  of the listing agents.

Ok, this is the trade of the decade. He bought it when bitcoin was 35kish.  Lost 20% selling the condo.  His bitcoin would have been down just short of 50%.  Ended up being a nice little dodge.

Here is a new technology, that not everyone understands. The experts in the field think it's astonishing and the uneducated think it's worthless.

This new technology is being used, replicated, copied, hacked, tested, run through the media, etc. It's over a decade like that and in that time everyone who knows the word bitcoin can be devided into two groups. Those that believe in it and think it's the future and major descovery, and those who think it's a fad or a Ponzi scheme, or a bubble. 

Yet, everyone who genuinely understands it is in the group that believes in it. Leaving the group that doesn't believe entirely made up of speculators who also don't understand it. 

""If that we're true then there would be an influx of people from one group to the other and the value would go up, but it's crash 80%"" - dinner table sceptic. 

Well the price is a see-saw and when the group of sceptics smell a quick buck you run to the other side then when you realise you don't know what your doing you run back. As you're the largest group by far that has a huge amount of movement in the price. Meanwhile that growing influx of people to the understand side have done there job of propping up one side of the seesaw.

18403,1672187348,False,"So I’ve noticed a strong trend developing of people asking quite legitimate questions of BTCs future and that of wider crypto, only to be met back with half baked platitudes, that those of us in the community have heard many times before. Despite this, there are some serious questions that the BTC community need to consider. I’ve detailed below a series of real life (not technical) issues that face BTC. If anyone can respond to them with genuine logical responses then please do so. If you feel compelled to reply with something like, ‘this is fud’ or ‘your comment is a buy signal’ or ‘we have seen this all before’ then just pop your self back in the poorly informed box from which you came. 

1. This time ‘is’ different. BTC has never witnessed a macro economic environment like this before. This is a fact. BTC performed as a ‘risk on asset’ only and is strongly correlated with the likes of the NSDQ. In an environment that may see major indexes like the S&amp;P, Dow, NSDQ fail to return ATH across a 10/15yr period, what would this mean for BTC? 

2. The ‘institutions’ are not coming. BTC took 10yrs to attract a comparatively slight level of institutional interest. Following significant issues around ESG compliance, repeated frauds and scams ala Tera and FTX etc as well as a lack of regulation, it is likely that institutions will struggle to regain any foothold within the space ever again. 

3. ‘We have seen this all before, Mt Gox etc’ No we haven’t. Never before has so much been lost by so many, in an environment that was already being lined up as a target by regulators. The core argument here being that the actions of a few ‘crypto’ bros have likely damaged the space so irrevocably that the coming regulation is likely to be punitive in the extreme. For retail it is highly likely that regulators will seek to control all on and off ramps making it near impossible to own or realise any gains. For institutions it is likely that the regulation will be designed to limit / prevent adoption. There will be no ETF, ever. 

4. Energy usage is an issue regardless of the facts of environmental impact. The energy price is not stabilising and is highly unlikely to do so under the current geopolitical conditions. This is now leading to a declining hash rate. This combined with little price action will lead to stagnation. 

5. What’s the narrative? As much as the maxis believe in the BTC gospel of freedoms and pharmaceutical grade money (I count my self within this) the only thing that has brought new people to the space is price speculation. With the above being true and the potential for little positive price action across a significant timeframe, what is the narrative that would bring new people to this space?",Time for an grown up conversation,0.74

the US dollar is the most useful money in the world, it has the biggest social network - a nation of 300 million every single person believes in the dollar as value even those who hate it and think money is the root of all evil are forced to respect its worth. And in the rest of the world too, because USA has the most political economic and military reach

so what the point in stacking sats if your not also trying to bring more people into our social network? youre just acquiring a larger share of something that is worthless 

Warren buffet said this about bitcoin

&gt;“If you said … for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I’ll write you a check this afternoon,” Buffett said. ”\[For\] $25 billion I now own 1% of the farmland. \[If\] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I’ll write you a check, it’s very simple. Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it? I’d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn’t going to do anything. The apartments are going to produce rent and the farms are going to produce food.”

he gets a lot of grief for being an old man yelling at clouds, but he's absolutely right here. owning all the bitcoin in the world would be like being the only person to have an email address, or a linkedin account. theres no one you could talk to. no one you could trade with

forget the dollar price of btc, its irrelevent. what matters - how many people have a btc wallet and how many know how to use it and value it enough that they would sell you a sandwich. if this number isnt going up and you keep stacking sats as an investment youre just buying a bigger share of nothing, this experiment will fail and the bubble will burst eventually. bitcoin's a lousy investment asset because it doesnt produce anything, it could be a good money one day, but thats up to us",stacking sats and hodl - counterproductive and almost pointless,0.22

What a year has been!

I joined Reddit a year ago and I felt in love right away! 😍 (I know I'm late, but I live in France and the use of this social is pretty uncommon here)

This sub in particular has been giving me huge (crypto related) food for thoughts, and it is also thanks to all of you that I sit on some humble gains 🙃 

**But more important, for the first time in my life I now know there is an alternative way to plan my future, till retirement when I am 70 years old!**

So, having said all that, I want you to give me a (not financial) advice as a gift, the one you'd give to your kid, in order to teach me something else and close this year in the best way!

Please note I don't want magic advices to become rich in 2 weeks, and above all I don't want you to mention any coin I should buy for life-changing gains! I just want you to share something that you think is important to stay safe in this market and keep improving my knowledge, while having a little fun 🙃

18537,1672245016,False,"When people think about buying bitcoin now, all they can do is fear the possibility of it going lower. This fear will exist at any price. I promise you even if Bitcoin goes back to 3k most people will be scared of it going lower and stay sidelined. The media doesn’t help at all by the way. Anyway, let’s look at it from this perspective. You buy 1 bitcoin at the current price of 17k and disregard any potential price drops. This is also just a thought experiment and I’m not assuming that the average Joe can just buy one bitcoin. Anyways, lets just say that within the next 3 years Bitcoin reaches a price of 150k. That means you’ll be in profit 133k. That means you’ll make roughly 45k a year. If you wait until 10k like every one is waiting for, you will have profited 140k. That’s like you making roughly 47k a year as opposed to the 45k you would make had you bought the one bitcoin now. When you look at it that way, it doesn’t really make a big difference if you buy now versus at 10k. 

This also doesn’t even factor in the risk that it never hits 10k and you never buy or eventually capitulate to the fomo of the bullrun and buy at a much higher price. If you take that risk plus the risk of you not even buying at 10k because of the extreme fud that will be present at the time, you will be rewarded with an extra 7k profit over 3 years. Think about it. If someone gave you the option of a guaranteed 133k in 3 years or a 50/50 chance of 140k, I think everyone knows what the smart option is.",Look at it from a different perspective,0.73

Now the progress has slowed to .01%/hour with an estimated completion time of \~1 year on the high end. Obviously not willing to wait a whole year to set this thing up so I've been trying to troubleshoot with no luck so far. I read that it is common for the synch to slow down once the blocks started getting filled with more information but would like to optimize settings on my end to get this thing moving. I intend to dedicate this laptop to running the node 24/7. 

&amp;#x200B;

Computer is a Windows with 4GB RAM and limited internal storage so I connected an external 1 TB HD (not SSD). The HD specs say capable of 150 MB/s read and write but task manager is showing 2.5 MB/s (. Because the laptop is reasonably capable (I was using it every day until recently) I suspect that the external drive connection is serving as an information chokepoint but am not sure how to resolve it. It's plugged in to a USB 3.0 port, assuming it's a 3.0 cable since I didn't verify. Computer connected to WiFi at 65 Mbps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read that an SSD will improve the synch speed, however the SSD I have on hand is too small. Could I buy one, yes but I also just blew a ton of money on Christmas stuff and I really don't want to if it can be helped. In a similar vein, I also don't want to change the RAM/CPU hardware since this is going to be a dedicated node.

&amp;#x200B;

Also read that increasing the database cache can help, I went from 450 to 1,000 and restarted the synch, looks like I may have marginally increased the MB/s to the external drive. Unsure how high I can increase without crashing the computer with only 4 GB RAM. Looks like I have \~800 MB of available memory at any given time and the program is using \~250 MB. Will increasing the DB Cache continue to provide an increase in synch speed or have I hit the point of diminishing returns if the program uses less memory than I've allocated for it? Currently using almost 90% of the RAM according to the task manager.

18642,1672284646,False,"I should preface this post by letting folks know that I am not a coder. That said however my concerns are that when newer versions of Bitcoin Core comes out you see bug fixes etc from the previous version but also there are occasionally changes to the rules of consensus. This essentially means that if you ""upgrade"" to the latest version, you effectively vote for that new rules of consensus from your version of what previously you voted bitcoin was. 

IMO there should be a differenent approach here. When bugs are found, why not update the older versions as well without touching the rules of consensus in said older versions?  You could still have the original versions available for reference however this approach would keep the bitcoin network safer and more robust while continuing to allow the individual node operators to decide what version of bitcoin is the true bitcoin which is the whole point! (aka decentralization) 

For example, I'm not a fan of Taro (or taproot in general for that matter) in the bitcoin protocol so I don't run bitcoin core beyond a certain version. Unfortunately these versions have apparently since had bugs reported and remedied by later versions.  That said my concern there is that eventually my versions may have fatal bugs uncovered and the only way to keep bitcoin running is to upgrade to something that I would consider to be true bitcoin.

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. In the mean time I'll continue to DCA and take immediate possession of my private keys to P2PKH addresses only which I generate offline as to forward this peaceful movement!","The Bitcoin Node Rules Of Consensus make Bitcoin well, Bitcoin however..",0.67

Do you think we will see smart contracts on the second layers of Bitcoin in the future and how do you think this will change the industry?   


I think it's likely that we will see smart contracts on second layers on Bitcoin in the future. This could be very revolutionary for the industry as it would enable users to create and execute contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain without clogging up the main blockchain. It would also allow users to create applications with more complex logic and transactions than are currently possible. In addition, it could open up the possibility for users to create and deploy decentralized applications (dapps) on the Bitcoin network. This could have a major impact on the industry as it could increase the utility of Bitcoin and potentially make it more attractive to a wider range of users.

18753,1672335383,False,"Bitcoin is many things but  one of the easiest ways to understand it is the concept of digital gold.

Bitcoin has the same properties that made gold a desirable financial asset(scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability, portability)

Bitcoin took these properties and improved them even further.

This makes Bitcoin a better and more efficient version of gold.

What is Gold good for as  a financial asset? Gold has been historically used as  a hedge against trouble in the monetary system and as a safe store of value.

Gold is not backed by anything other than itself. The price is determined by supply and demand alone. Gold allows you to self-custody wealth. Gold can't be inflated so it protects you against the inflation tax of the government. Gold also can't be destroyed. It's not a company or a government that can fail. Holding gold has no counterparty risk.

Gold is universally recognized as money. Despite that virtually no business accepts it as  a medium of exchange and it's not backed by governments.

Why is Bitcoin better than gold?

It can be easily divided.

It can be instantly sent to any person on earth.

The inflation rate of Bitcoin is lower.

It can be integrated in any software application. Gold ATMs for example are rare and not very practical and Bitcoin ATMs common. This highlights that it's digital nature makes it very easy to use and  integrate it in businesses.

It's easy to verify that your Bitcoin is real.

It's has no storage cost.

You can move any quantity that you want at  a low cost.

It's harder to confiscate.

Gold has played an important role in finance for thousands of years. In recent decades it's importance has lessened. Nevertheless it's still  a multi trillion dollar asset class.

As gold has been important for thousands of years in finance it can be expected that digital gold will also play  a role in our world no matter how small or big that role might be.

One of the reasons why gold has not been more successful in recent history might be that it's slow and difficult to move making it incompatible with a fast-paced modern and global economy.

Bitcoin on the other hand is uniquely suited to  a digital global economy and a world where fiat currencies are just melting ice cubes. Even central banks seem to be increasingly turning back to gold after decades. As Bitcoin is better gold for  a digital world it may play  a bigger role in the future as many might expect.",What is Bitcoin and what is it good for?,0.77

So here it is; some interesting btc stats and info related to number of wallets, total holdings and categories of wallets. All stats are derived from bitinfocharts dot come and wayback machine. Enjoy! :)

&amp;#x200B;

On 30dec2022:

The number of  addresses  holding 1+ BTC reached an ATH of 977k

The number of  addresses  holding 0.1+ BTC reached an ATH of 4.2mil

The number of  addresses holding 0.01+ BTC reached an ATH of 11,4 mil

&amp;#x200B;

In 2022 from Jan till Dec the category of  addresses  holding between 1-10 btc increased from 724k to 822k. The BTC holdings for this category increased from 1.8mil to 2.0mil btc

In 2022 from Jan till Dec the category of  addresses  holding between 0.1-1 btc increased from 2.77mil to 3.22mil. The BTC holdings for this category increased from 859k to 1.0mil btc

In 2022 from Jan till Dec the category of  addresses  holding between 0.01 -0.1 btc increased from 6.68mil to 7.22mil. The BTC holdings for this category increased from 218k to 243k btc

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Where did the selling pressure come from?

Between jan22 and dec22  addresses holding between 1k-10k btc sold aproximately 471k btc. This category probably includes a lot of btc miners among others.

Between jan22 and dec22  addresses holding between above &gt;100k btc sold approximately 108k btc. This category includes exchange wallets and probably accounts for withdrawals after black swan events (people moving their btc from exchanges to self custody).

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts. We know that 1 address does not equal 1 person. Even so, taking everything into consideration, 2022 was a great year for retail with huge growth both in terms of # of addresses and amount of btc held by lower categories of holders, from 0.01+ btc up to 10btc.

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the current price of btc in $ vs actual demand (or lack of) we can see that there is still a huge road ahead. Overall though, I'd say 2022 was a great year for adoption, a textbook year showcasing all the reasons and benefits of owning BTC.",BTC 2022 End of Year Stats,0.7

\- When people like Jack Mallers (who I love) say things like transactions on LN will cost nothing or fractions of a penny, how is that possible? What's to stop a company like Stripe to just increase fees? 

\- How are the transactions secure? Base layer has validations happening, whats occurring on LN to validate and safeguard a transaction?

\- Are there any onboarding ramps yet, other than LN wallet apps? I know Jack spoke at length about connections to POS systems on retail, but where's the user onboarding going to come from? I'm trying to look at this from a retail PoV and see how I can get customers off of using CC's to pay for a $3 retail transaction.

They probably won't be able to get a first job until 16 years old, which is 6 years from now, which is year 2028.

In the year 2028, what do you think bitcoin will be worth? I think at least 50k. If 2025 it goes to 100k, then crashes down to 30k in 2026, goes sideways a year in 2027 and up in 2028, bitcoin is 50k.

If you worked minimum wage at 16, in 2028, you probably are taking home 1000 a week if you were doing it full time?

Which means you would need to take home 1000 a week every single week that you are 16 years old (a full year) and not spend anything, to buy 1 bitcoin, assuming it stays at 50k.

BUT.... If it goes down in 2026, sideways in 2027, slightly up in 2028, then 2029 is the bull run. 

If 2029, it bull runs to 150k, the kid only has enough money for a third of a btc buying at the top, assuming he doesn't spend any money at all. If we assume he DCA'ed on the way up to 150 and bought the bear dip after 150 too, then maybe he has half a bitcoin or more.

Then, 2030 crashes to 50k, and the kid is 17, still bringing home 1000 a week, but now has a half bitcoin in his pocket, so now he needs only 25k to buy the other half, but he would have to spend the 25k at the exact bottom, which won't happen. 

If we assume he DCA's after 50 was hit and hovers around 80k for 2031, he would have to spend 40k of the 50k he will take home in 2031 to get the other half of the bitcoin.

So yeah, I guess there is a chance that today's 10 year old will be able to get to 1 bitcoin before his 18th birthday.

Comments keep getting deleted for an odd reason.

&gt; The owners of these pools do not own other people's hashpower.

You are running their software. That is all you are doing when you join a pool. You agree to **their terms and conditions*. You are joining a pool or a node.

&gt; What you don't understand is the fact that if the gov came to shut down or control a pool( even tho they would literally gain nothing from doing so) poeple would see this and immediately leave the pool and join another.

The government would ""control"" a pool to seize (stolen) coins. A node is in the business to make money, not fight government. Nodes have invested millions of dollars into hardware. Just because some schmuck in his moms basement leaves a pool, nobody will fucking care. The big guys dont have your mentality. They want to make money. They will obey. Like I said, email Mike if you dont believe me ;)

 &gt; I can join ANYONES operation at any fuck!n time.

Dude, you are running a damn laptop from your moms basement. No one fucking cares if you leave a pool. 

&gt; Nothing is stopping anyone from doing so and even if the police handcuffed the ceo of one of these pools and said "" give me all the hashpower"" they literally cannot stop poeple from pulling out because they don't control everyone's hashpower. If the police even considered doing something so dumb, that pool would be emptier faster than you can say I don't understand what I'm talking about.

The pool would obey, you'd continue running their software. Again, a node is there to make money, not be anarchists or fight the government. 

&gt; These pools cannot re-write or take away ANY transactions without a re org of the Blockchain. You seriously don't understand what you are talking about. Once it's in the Blockchain and validated, there is no way to un do that transaction....

Miners wouldn't ""undo"" a tx. They would simply accredit an address with x number of coins, and discredit the address the coins came from. The history would remain on the blockchain. 

&gt; Now once again, and don't ignore this question this time. What's the difference between a Bitcoin miner and a Bitcoin node.

The definition of a node is in the whitepaper: 

&gt; The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As

18958,1672444007,False,"During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on December 13, John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, told members of Congress that FTX U.S. had 2.7 million user accounts while FTX International had 7.6 million user accounts. That’s a total of 10.3 million potential customers of FTX that may have been bilked out of some or all of their funds by the alleged mastermind, Sam Bankman-Fried, and his co-conspirators. That’s more than 250 times the defrauded customers of Ponzi mastermind Bernie Madoff.

While Ray acknowledged that some FTX users had multiple accounts, even if you cut the 10.3 million user accounts by as much as two-thirds, 3.4 million accounts is still 85 times the number of Madoff victims.

If you throw into the mix that Madoff acquired his victims over more than four decades and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX has been in operation for less than four years, the scope of the number of people impacted is stunning. And if one considers the customer losses at other crypto companies that have filed bankruptcy, potentially as a result of their exposure to FTX, the total dollar amount of losses may come close to or even exceed the estimated $17.8 billion of lost principal in the Madoff fraud.

• The cost of electricity, which is one of the main expenses for miners, can vary greatly depending on where a mining operation is located.

• In some areas, electricity may be generated primarily from renewable sources, which can be cheaper than electricity generated from fossil fuels under certain circumstances.

• The cost of cooling equipment may be lower in some locations due to natural factors such as lower ambient temperatures or greater supply of more efficient cooling technology.

• Some countries or regions may have regulations that make it difficult or expensive to set up a mining operation, while others may be more welcoming to the industry.

Download a fresh wallet on a different device and send the funds to it, then delete the existing wallet once funds are sent and back up the new one?

I was wondering if it really matters using Tails or a fresh installation of MacOS in this case since both will be ""destroyed"" before reconnecting the computer to the internet. I kinda trust MacOS more than Tails in this case since Tails could be doing something like pretending to be disconnected form the internet when it is actually not, something way more difficult to happen on macOS.",Is Tails really safer than MacOS to create a seed on Electrum?,0.76

Apologies for my English, I’m French.

I’m looking to relocate to the US from Latin America to meet fellow bitcoiners.

Yet I’m still not sure where I should go.

I was thinking Austin, TX (austin bitcoin club, big tech oriented city), or Nashville, TN (bitcoin park, bitcoin magazine). 
However, I recently saw that the state of Wyoming is doing big steps towards becoming a bitcoin state.

My goal is to find bitcoiners, attend meets and stack as much as possible.

So where do you think I should move to ?

Nashville, Austin or another place ?

Thanks for helping !",Best US Bitcoin City / State ?,0.74
